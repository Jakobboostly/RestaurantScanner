# How to Download Files from Replit

## Method 1: Replit Download Feature

The download option might be in different locations depending on your Replit version:

### Option A: Three-dot menu (most common)
1. Look for three dots (⋮) in the **top right corner** of your Replit interface
2. Click the three dots
3. Look for "Download as zip" or "Export" option
4. Click it to download

### Option B: File menu
1. Look for "File" in the top menu bar
2. Click "File" → "Download as zip"

### Option C: Kebab menu (newer Replit versions)
1. Look for the hamburger menu (≡) or kebab menu (⋮) near the file explorer
2. Click it and look for "Download" or "Export" option

## Method 2: Manual File Creation (If download doesn't work)

If you can't find the download option, I'll help you create the files manually:

### Step 1: Create the project structure locally
Create these folders on your computer:
```
restaurant-scanner/
├── client/src/components/ui/
├── client/src/hooks/
├── client/src/lib/
├── client/src/pages/
├── server/services/
├── server/utils/
└── shared/
```

### Step 2: Copy essential files
I'll provide you with the exact content of each file to copy-paste.

## Method 3: Use GitHub Import (Alternative)

If downloading is difficult, we can:
1. Create a GitHub repository first
2. Use GitHub's import feature to pull directly from Replit
3. Clean up the repository after import

## Method 4: Use Replit's GitHub Integration

Some Replit accounts have GitHub integration:
1. Look for a "GitHub" button in your Replit interface
2. Click "Connect to GitHub" or "Push to GitHub"
3. Follow the prompts to create a repository

Let me know which method you'd like to try, and I'll provide detailed instructions for that approach.
