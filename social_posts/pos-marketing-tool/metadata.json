Let’s dive in.Understanding Your POS as a Marketing ToolMost restaurant owners use their POS system to manage customer orders and transactions. What you might not know is that your POS is also a powerful database storing valuable customer information such as contact details, dining preferences, and purchase history. By leveraging this data, restaurants can launch personalized marketing campaigns with compelling offers and updates.The most valuable data stored in your POS are the phone numbers of customers who have ordered in the past 18 months. These numbers are typically collected when customers place orders online, or if the POS requires them to enter their phone number when ordering at the restaurant. Once an owner has collected a substantial list of customer data, they are primed to take advantage of the greatest revenue tool for restaurants: SMS Marketing.Benefits of SMS Marketing for RestaurantsSMS marketing has proven to be the most effective form of restaurant marketing for several reasons:Immediate and direct communication: SMS has an impressive open rate of over 98%, ensuring your audience sees your message almost instantly.
