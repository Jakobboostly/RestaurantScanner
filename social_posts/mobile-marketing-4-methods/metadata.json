This means enhancing your mobile marketing strategies to make discovering and ordering from your restaurant a breeze. Below, you'll find practical advice and tools designed to kick-start this process and boost your digital presence, ensuring your eatery stands out in a mobile-centric world.What does mobile marketing mean?It's all about reaching your audience through their most personal devices—smartphones, tablets, and beyond. Imagine your restaurant popping up via websites that look great on any screen, through timely text messages, engaging social media posts, and instant push notifications.The Importance for Restaurants: Think about it; mobile devices are like extensions of ourselves these days. With a staggering 81% of diners searching for eateries on these devices and 75% making choices based on what they find, not being visible on mobile means missing a huge slice of the pie.Starting Point: Reflect on your own mobile usage—browsing, app checking, texting. This personal insight is golden for shaping a mobile marketing approach that resonates with your audience. Let’s dive into three of the best tactics for making your restaurant's presence felt in the mobile world, right where your customers are:1. Make Your Restaurant Website Mobile-FriendlyStudies show that the majority of web traffic on restaurant websites comes from mobile users, underscoring the importance of a mobile-friendly site experience. 48% of users reported getting annoyed or frustrated when restaurants don’t have mobile-friendly sites, causing them to leave the site for another. It might sound intimidating, but with the right tools, making a mobile-friendly site can be simple. For example, restaurants can get a premium website built by the experts at our official partner, ChowNow, complete with full ordering optimization as part of ChowNow Pro.Make sure it’s responsiveA responsive website can recognize what type of device is being used and automatically adjust to its size, so the content is easy to view on any phone, tablet, or desktop. It can also help boost your search rankings, as Google and other search engines favor mobile-friendly sites over others.Not sure which website-building platform to start with? Squarespace, BentoBox, Wix and Duda are just a few great options to look into. Optimize for speedMobile users are typically less patient than those on a desktop device. A delay of just a few seconds can lead to potential customers abandoning your site for good. To make your site faster, compress images, avoid videos with large file sizes, and leverage browser caching.Google has a free tool called PageSpeed that can identify parts of your site that make it slow. You can also use a free tool like Tinify to compress your larger images and videos.Streamline navigation and contentThink of this as an extension of speed. Users don’t want to waste time navigating your site to find what they’re looking for. Thinking minimally can really help your design and speed up the time it takes for diners to order. Large buttons that standout and a simple website menu that’s easy to find can help boost orders and ticket sizes.Not sure where to start?

Create Your Own Ordering AppDeveloping a custom ordering app isn't reserved for the big players alone. In fact, numerous small and independent eateries are jumping on the app bandwagon, enjoying double the order volumes as a result (you read that right, restaurants with their own branded apps see a 2x increase in orders!). It might seem daunting, but there are services tailored to streamline this process, offering to build and launch your branded iOS and Android apps using just your basic restaurant details. Our friends at ChowNow need nothing more than the basics (i.e. your menu, logo, pricing, hours, etc.) to create your own custom branded iOS and/or Android app. Once your app is live, strategic marketing can encourage your customers to start placing orders through it.Link to your restaurant app everywhereUpdate your social media bios to include a link to your app. Send out emails that tell diners about your app and encourage them to download. You can also create flyers and posters to hang up inside your dining room, so customers know that your app is the best way to order while they’re on the go. Basically whenever you mention online ordering, drive diners to your app.If you don’t want to do it all yourself, ChowNow can do it for you. Mobile apps, automated emails, and print marketing are all included in the ChowNow Pro su",
