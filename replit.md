# Restaurant Scanner - Complete Full-Stack Application

## Overview

This is a comprehensive restaurant website scanner application built with React and Express.js. The application allows users to search for restaurants, analyze their websites, and receive detailed performance reports including SEO, mobile responsiveness, and user experience metrics. It's designed as a pixel-perfect clone of Owner.com's restaurant scanner functionality.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Storage**: In-memory storage with interface for database integration
- **API Integration**: Google Places API, PageSpeed API, SERP API
- **Session Management**: Built-in session handling

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Restaurants Table**: Stores restaurant information including name, address, Google Place ID, domain, and ratings
- **Scans Table**: Stores website scan results with performance metrics, issues, and recommendations

### API Services

## Data Flow

1. **Restaurant Search**: User enters restaurant name → Frontend queries Google Places API → Results displayed with ratings and location data
2. **Website Scanning**: User selects restaurant → Backend retrieves website details → Multiple API calls for performance analysis → Progress updates streamed to frontend
3. **Results Display**: Scan completion → Structured data presentation with scores, issues, and actionable recommendations

## External Dependencies
