What DataForSEO Can Handle Excellently:
1. Keyword Research & SEO Analysis

DataForSEO Labs API: Keywords for site analysis, related keywords, keyword suggestions, keyword difficulty scoring, search intent analysis, and search volume data
Competitor Research: SERP competitors analysis, domain intersection, ranked keywords for competitors, and historical ranking data
Local Search Intelligence: Google Maps data, local business listings, and location-specific search results

2. Business Data & Reviews

Google My Business Data: My Business info, reviews, Q&A, and business updates
Review Analysis: Extended reviews with sentiment analysis capabilities
Business Listings: Comprehensive business directory data across multiple platforms

3. Website Technical Analysis

On-Page API: Website performance analysis, technical SEO audits, mobile experience, page speed insights via Lighthouse integration, duplicate content detection, and comprehensive technical issue identification
Domain Analytics: 360° website overview including traffic analysis, tech stack monitoring, and Whois data

Major Concerns with Your Current Approach:
1. Google Places API Dependency
You're planning to use Google Places API just to get basic restaurant info, but DataForSEO's Business Data API already provides this. You're adding unnecessary complexity and cost.
2. Overly Complex N8N Workflow
100+ restaurant scans per day with polling every 5 seconds? That's 17,280 API calls just for status checking. DataForSEO offers both Standard and Live methods - use Live for instant results instead of polling.
3. Missing DataForSEO's Core Strengths
Your current plan underutilizes what DataForSEO excels at:

AI-Powered SERP Analysis: The AI Summary endpoint can analyze search results and provide insights with custom prompts
Historical Data: Track ranking changes over time and seasonal trends
Content Gap Analysis: Identify missing content opportunities using keyword research tools
