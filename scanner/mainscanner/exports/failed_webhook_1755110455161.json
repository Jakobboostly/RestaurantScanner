Little mini Brazilian pizza bites (about 4‚Äù round mini pizzas), both savory and sweet. The pizzas average about $2.75 each. It does take a bit of time to get your order because they make everything fresh, but definitely worth the wait. There‚Äôs not a lot of seating here, so plan on taking them home! This was the perfect place for a really good snack. It hit the spot! Go try it- we‚Äôll definitely be back to try other flavors!",

It took about 5 minutes to receive and they present you with your order to ensure everything looks right. The staff were complimentary and kind.\n\nThe two mini desserts were great tasting and simply made. I think it‚Äôs a fair price and a nice splurge. The Mad Berry was my preferred because of the condensed milk. 5 stars due to the uniqueness of the theme and experience, with fair pricing and real ingredients. I‚Äôll come back to try the savory dishes.",
