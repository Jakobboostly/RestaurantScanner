I feel it is priced well for what you get. üòÅ\n\nUnfortunately, we will probably not be back (at least to this location) because we didn‚Äôt feel welcomed. We went in on Friday 07/25 at about 8:40. We did not plan on dining in because we knew they were closing soon, so we ordered to go. We had just gotten off work and wanted to try something new to end off the day better. We did notice three workers cleaning up but figured we still have a few minutes to order. (If it was any later than 15 minutes before closing we would have went elsewhere) As soon as we walked in one of the kids with blonde hair yelled ‚ÄúCOME ON BRO‚Äù while looking directly at us. I know they were probably annoyed because it was late on a Friday night, but I found that very unprofessional and unwelcoming considering we ordered before the actual closing time which is 9 PM. Basically right after we ordered they went to go lock the doors and it was 8:45. If you‚Äôre planning on coming here late, I recommend calling first to ensure that they will actually be opened. Based off of other reviews, this has happened before.",
