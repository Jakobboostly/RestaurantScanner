Nestled near the beautiful Thanksgiving tulip gardens, it truly feels like a hidden gem worth discovering. Every bite—from the perfectly crafted sandwiches to the flavorful sauces and delicious sides—was spot on. You can taste the care and quality in everything they serve. This spot has officially become a must-stop every time we visit. Five stars all around—well done, Melty’s!",

The cheese fries and the cheese goods were also good, but nothing to write home about. Overall, the food was good but after tip we spent $42 between 2 people and that feels incredibly overpriced for a sandwich, a side and a medium drink, so I'm not sure I would go back for that reason alone.",

Do not be dissuaded because it's connected to a gas station. They have so many great varieties of grilled cheese, it was hard to decide what to get. I settled on the BBQ brisket, and it was an excellent choice. The meat was so tender and loaded with plenty of gooey cheese. The bread was toasted to perfection. My son gave me a bite of his French dip, and it was just as good. For the side, I ordered the mac 'n' cheese, and it was possibly the best I've ever had, including the stuff I lovingly make at home on the smoker. Convinced yet? Just go!",
