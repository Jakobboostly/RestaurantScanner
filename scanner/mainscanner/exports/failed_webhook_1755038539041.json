The service was excellent—our server was kind, attentive, and even brought a sample of the enchilada sauce to make sure it wasn’t too spicy for me, which I really appreciated.\n\nWe started with the shrimp bites appetizer—absolutely delicious! The balsamic glaze was divine and complemented the shrimp perfectly. I ordered the spring enchiladas and loved every bite. The flavors were fresh, and the small side salad was a lovely touch.\n\nThe atmosphere was beautiful and added to the overall experience. Our server made the evening feel warm and fun. I would definitely recommend this place and look forward to coming back!",
