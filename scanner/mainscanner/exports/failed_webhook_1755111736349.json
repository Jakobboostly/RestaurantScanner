This Thai-inspired pizza is a flavor explosion, perfectly balancing the savory richness of peanut sauce with the sweet tang of pineapple, the fresh bite of green onion and cilantro, and the smoky depth of roasted red peppers. It's a unique and incredibly delicious combination that you won't find anywhere else. Beyond the phenomenal taste, Slab Pizza consistently delivers on great prices and truly amazing service. If you're looking for an unforgettable pizza experience, \"The Meikel\" is a must-try!",

The ingredients tasted fresh, they have all the condiments you need and the dough was very crispy and delicious. Although they didn't have ranch so that's not good.\n\nI just think the building itself is pretty dead. I know the location doesn't help but it's very quiet and unlively here. This place also attracts immodest young adults that don't care about manners and cleaning up after themselves.\n\nThe restaurant itself is great. It's the location and the regular customers I have issues with.",

The service is fast, friendly, and the employees are always willing to listen, help and problem solve. The owner is phenomenally positive, kind and works alongside the others to help things run smoothly. Modifications to toppings are always allowed (you want arugula & rosemary dust on top? Just ask!) and a gluten free crust is no problem here. The dining area, kitchen and bathroom are all exceptionally clean. This is even more remarkable given the sheer number of customers served daily. My nephew wrote his college application essay about SLAB pizza, and HE WAS ACCEPTED! THANKS SLAB!! Your pizza üçï is second only to your high quality service!",
