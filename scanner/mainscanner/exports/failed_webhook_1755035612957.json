Both the sushi and the sushi appetizer were tasty and I love food with some spice so the pink dragon was perfect for me. The sesame balls have to be my favorite bit about my order though! Loved them!!! I would go again just to eat these cuties again! Service was fast and the food is reasonably priced. Love the aesthetic and cute decorations. I’ll definitely be back!",

Each roll that we ordered was very tasty and we were happy with each selection. We had the: Tiger eyes, Breeze, Treasure roll, Crazies, and Salmon avacado roll.\nThe seating is set up with good spacing. Cute decor and loved the lighting set up. The umbrellas hanging from the ceiling gave a cool vibe.\nOne complaint is the drinks weren’t listed on the menu at all, so we had to ask what was available.",

I mentioned that my wife is pregnant and can’t eat raw fish, and without hesitation they offered to custom-make any roll with cooked fish. That kind of flexibility isn’t something you get everywhere, and we really appreciated it.\n\nThe food itself was excellent—fresh, flavorful, and well put together. My wife loved her custom rolls, and everything I tried was just as good. Overall, a solid experience from start to finish. We’ll definitely be back.",

I mentioned that my wife is pregnant and can’t eat raw fish, and without hesitation they offered to custom-make any roll with cooked fish. That kind of flexibility isn’t something you get everywhere, and we really appreciated it.\n\nThe food itself was excellent—fresh, flavorful, and well put together. My wife loved her custom rolls, and everything I tried was just as good. Overall, a solid experience from start to finish. We’ll definitely be back.",

Both the sushi and the sushi appetizer were tasty and I love food with some spice so the pink dragon was perfect for me. The sesame balls have to be my favorite bit about my order though!

I was very impressed with the quality of the fish and veggies, and they came together beautifully. We especially enjoyed the Firey Jalapeno appetizer - that was the unexpected highlight of the meal!\nThe sushi is very reasonably priced, and the appetizers were very cheap (get the gyoza, it's delicious). The Red Devil and Blaze Rolls were our favorites, but anything with a lime was very tasty.\nWe will absolutely bring the family here again, even our kids liked it!",

That kind of flexibility isn’t something you get everywhere, and we really appreciated it.\n\nThe food itself was excellent—fresh, flavorful, and well put together.
