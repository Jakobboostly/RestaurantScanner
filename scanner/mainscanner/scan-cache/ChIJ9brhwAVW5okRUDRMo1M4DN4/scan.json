We played laser tag three times in a row because it was just that much fun‚Äîwe couldn‚Äôt stop laughing and running around.\n\nThe highlight of the day had to be when one of my friends hit the 1,000-ticket jackpot on the big spinning wheel game. We all screamed and cheered like crazy‚Äîit felt like we‚Äôd just won the lottery. Between the games, the prizes, and hanging out with my friends, it was the perfect birthday celebration.\n\nI really hope I can go back to Nomads with my friends again soon. It‚Äôs the kind of place where you can have non-stop fun, and every visit feels like an adventure.",

So many of the games were not working, a few of the two player games had only one side working.  We finished playing and went to cash out our tickets. The young lady working the counter looked tired, frustrated and she was rude.  Not the best experience for our first time there.  I will say the place was very clean. If only they maintained the actual games better.",

          "text": "I recently had my daughter's birthday party here. We had a good time but I have some major complaints that I can't get over which will prevent me from ever going back to your establishment. First of all, I added a bunch of food to my package and when I got there the day of there were multiple items missing that I had called to add on. When my salad came out (probably 40 minutes after the food was served) it was completely rotten and wilted. No one ate it. Having food standards is the most important part of offering food, I can't believe your cooks thought it was ok to serve food that had gone bad. After we finished the food our party host then points at 4 kids and says \"THEY CAN'T PLAY ANY ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF THEIR SHOES\". Now understand that we  have disappointed kids and we are scrambling around to find things to accommodate for their shoes. It was embarrassing. Our party host said \"Well it was on the disclaimer\". Your website says that lazer tag requires close toed shoes and no crocs. Every kid was wearing closed toed shoes and not a single kid was wearing crocs, they were wearing UGGS. I understand our allotted time was up in our room but after the kids were running around all night we asked if we could get some water and 2 different employees told us NO and that we HAD to leave. These are children ages 9-11, depriving them of water is unethical by any means. I added on goodie bags at least a week ahead, and when I arrived at our party I reminded our party host that we got goodie bags. She said she didn't receive notice of this but assured me that we would have them. When the party ended and the kids were looking for water and parents were coming to pick up the kids, we had no goodie bags. I couldn't find our party host so I asked the lady at the front desk. The goodie bags arrived 10 minutes after and plenty of kids already left the party without their goodie bag and dehydrated. When we asked the guy running the tea cups to stop the ride because someone was feeling sick, he didn't!!!!!!! You should be ashamed of yourselves. I will never recommend anyone have a party at Nomads.",

Their pizza had some Italian spices which added some flavor but might have made it less appealing for some kids. The chicken tenders were good. It has a bit of a 90s vibe with the pitcher drinks and wooden picnic tables.\n\nWe just walked through the arcade but there were a ton of games and none that we saw were out of order. If also be curious to try the mini golf one day too.",

He was going to assist afterwards till girlie explained the process. Other dude was like couldn't have explained it better myself. Couldn't have been more annoying tbh.

          "text": "Terrible party experience from start to finish.\n\nTo begin with, we booked the themed \"Space\" room. The theming is three small pictures hung on the wall. The website shows this gorgeous Under The Sea room with murals on the walls as an example of their themed rooms. We talked to the manager about this and he said, \"oh, well we were going to decorate it last year but then we didn't. Now we leave as a room you can decorate yourself.\" I explained that I booked a themed room, not a \"decorate yourself\" room but he didn't care.\n\nNext up was the service. The party began 45 minutes late because they were running behind. We were supposed to do the arcade games at the end, but we let the kids do that first since they were running so behind. But even then, that only took a few minutes (they give you just enough for every kid to play one or two games). We kept asking where the food was and were told it was coming. It finally arrived. There's supposed to be a party host to serve the food to the kids, but there was none. They dropped the food and left. We had no utensils, no gloves to serve the food with, no cups for the drinks. Nothing.\n\nWe eventually got that stuff (after making the kids wait even longer). I asked for cups. For 17 kids, plus parents, the person brought me 12 cups. Yes, 12 cups. At no time did anyone offer to help with serving the food or drinks or anything (which I was told was included). We complained about this, but they blamed us. They said, \"well you came during shift change.\" (We came when they booked us.)\n\nThe arcade is terrible. It kept taking kids' credits but not letting them play the game. The kids get 20 credits. One of the games takes 15 credits to play. These are eight year olds, they didn't understand that.\n\nAnd then the redemption center was horrible. There's almost nothing there. I asked the kid behind the counter what my daughter could get for under 300 tickets (since I couldn't see anything other than a jar of loose tootsie rolls and a single squishy ball) and he said, \"not much, we ran out of most of the stuff.\" I kid you not. That was his response. So we left with a couple hundred tickets unspent because there was nothing to spend it on. Which I guess is their goal? If you don't spend your tickets it's more money for them.\n\nThis place is a disorganized mess. From the management all the way down to the staff, they absolutely don't care one bit about your experience. Their party packages are a major bait and switch scheme, and the whole place is rundown and in need of major renovations. Just a gross experience from start to finish. We really regret having chosen them for my daughter's birthday party.\n\nEdit: by the way, I posted this review three years ago. Not once, any time after the review or our complaints to the company, did anyone reach out to say \"hey, sorry you had a bad experience, we'd like to make this up to you.\" They got our money, they were done with us. The lack of a response from management to reviews like this shows you how you'll be treated when you have a similar experience. You are warned.",
