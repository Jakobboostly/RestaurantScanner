I was under the impression that the business offered delivery service, but after placing the order I started receiving unknown texts regarding my order that further delivery instructions were needed. I was confused. I called Big City Pizza about this and inquired and was informed that DoorDash was delivering it. I asked why wasn‚Äôt I informed when I ordered but never received a definitive answer and their website doesn‚Äôt mention DoorDash. I kept receiving texts from DoorDash after I had cancelled my order with Big City. Also, a delivery driver from Dash showed up at my door to deliver & I informed her the order was cancelled & to contact Big City. Was very displeased with the unprofessional & misleading service. (Note: i will say the young man initially took my order at Big City was kind & pleasant on the phone.)",

We ordered three pizzas and boneless ‚Äúwings‚Äù last night. The pizzas were all so so dry and tasted just cheap like gas station pizza. The boneless wings are disgusting,  with meat similar to mcD nuggets, that chicken paste, very mushy and the breading is half as thick as the chicken, but without the crunch of mcD.. The Mac and cheese wedges are also gross, you can tell they come frozen from a box! Now listen, where credit is due is the services they‚Äôre very nice people and I hate to give the business a harsh critique but I‚Äôm sick of these restaurants lowering the quality of their food and keeping prices the same. They may say they haven‚Äôt changed anything in the past 4 years but they absolutely have and if I‚Äôm going to eat trash, I‚Äôll just go to Dominos\n\n2020-This place is so good, so quick, and so sweet! Got a discount due to the quarantine situation.\nThe staff was great, and so friendly. We live within a mile of the place and come often and always satisfied.",

However this time I decided to get a calzone figuring it would be pretty easy and it should be good considering the pizza is great...Ohh So Not the case. Being originally from New England I was under the impression that a calzone was a self-explanatory item... Traditionally it's pizza folded in half with main ingredients ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese and then you add whatever toppings you'd like to put inside.. some places add a little buttery garlic on top of the dough or even on the inside to make it more flavorful but never have I ever heard of the main ingredient to be mozzarella cheese and sauce because that would be stromboli... Confused as I was I tried to order it in the traditional fashion and it did not come out great... It was flat kind of like a stromboli saturated in butter and garlic it was so heavy and greasy with very little ricotta cheese inside. I was so disappointed, though I will get pizza again,  I will never order a calzone from here.ü§∑",

When I called the attitude from the employee was terrible. I brought the pizza back he ‚Äúre-made‚Äù it for me. This time the pizza was just barely cooked the  dough was still raw and there was so much cheese on it the first few layers were hardly melted thus creating the crust base to be soggy. I would have been better off buying a $5 frozen pizza from the grocery store. I would never again get a pizza from here even if it was free. Terrible",

          "text": "The Tipsy Chicken pizza from Big City Pizza is an absolute delight for the taste buds. From the first bite, I was blown away by the perfect combination of flavors and textures. The succulent pieces of grilled chicken are generously spread across the pizza, providing a juicy and tender bite in every slice. The crispy bacon adds a delightful smoky sweetness that perfectly complements the savory chicken.\n\nWhat sets this pizza apart is the unique twist of the bourbon glaze which adds a tangy and slightly spicy kick to the overall flavor profile. The sauce is perfectly balanced, not overpowering the other ingredients but enhancing them instead. The crust is just right! providing a satisfying crunch with each bite. The combination of flavors in the Tipsy Chicken pizza is truly a match made in pizza heaven, and I find myself craving it time and time again. Big City Pizza has truly created a masterpiece with this pizza, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal.",

Pizza arrive on time but was only warm at best, which wasn't terrible, but the cheese.....where did it go? The outer like 3 inches of our pizza had no cheese. It was like all heaped in the middle and that's it. Called restaurant to just basically let them know and the lady was like well you know we only put like 2 1/2c for XL. I was like its not a problem with the quantity of cheese you put on it's the placement. I'm sure your customers will not be coming back if only 1/2 of their pizza now comes with cheese . I would have given it 1 star, but on a good note, their cinna knots were awesome! Made up for disappointing pizza.",

However this time I decided to get a calzone figuring it would be pretty easy and it should be good considering the pizza is great...Ohh So Not the case. Being originally from New England I was under the impression that a calzone was a self-explanatory item... Traditionally it's pizza folded in half with main ingredients ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese and then you add whatever toppings you'd like to put inside.. some places add a little buttery garlic on top of the dough or even on the inside to make it more flavorful but never have I ever heard of the main ingredient to be mozzarella cheese and sauce because that would be stromboli... Confused as I was I tried to order it in the traditional fashion and it did not come out great... It was flat kind of like a stromboli saturated in butter and garlic it was so heavy and greasy with very little ricotta cheese inside. I was so disappointed, though I will get pizza again,  I will never order a calzone from here.ü§∑",
