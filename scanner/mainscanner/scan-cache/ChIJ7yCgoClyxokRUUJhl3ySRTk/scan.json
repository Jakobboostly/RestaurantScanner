The roll tasted stale.  The sandwich was very, very dry to the point of being hard to swallow.  Tasted and looked like it had very little oil.  I had to add some of my own.  You had to actually hunt for the lettuce and onions.  No taste at all.  It was very bland.  The last time I got one the experience was very similar.  I suggest unless you order pizza to find another place for your sandwich.",

The roll tasted stale.  The sandwich was very, very dry to the point of being hard to swallow.  Tasted and looked like it had very little oil.  I had to add some of my own.  You had to actually hunt for the lettuce and onions.  No taste at all.  It was very bland.  The last time I got one the experience was very similar.  I suggest unless you order pizza to find another place for your sandwich.",

We had the Italian sausage and flounder entrees and both were plentiful portions and came with hefty sides. The sausage was spicy and the Caesar salad was a meal of its own.  Only one bathroom exists for both genders so you may have a wait. Figure $30 per person.",

Our waitress was friendly and easy going. Our food was hot and fresh. I had stuffed shells which came in a metal dish on a plate. The dish had obviously been in the oven to melt the cheese and I was warned it would be hot. I even enjoyed a nice slice of Reece's peanut butter cake. I would highly recommend this for a night out with family or friends.",

When we got our food we could see that the wings looked very very well done, took a bite and they were hard and very dry and chewy, not good at all, we could not eat them. Next up was the cheese steak, 1st thing I noticed was didn't look like there was any cheese on this cheese steak, I put my readers on to have a closer look searching for any traces of cheese, after searching I finally found a tiny bit of cheese on the one half of the steak. Took a few bites and the meat had a lot of grizzle in it which I had to spit out   cause my jaw was having whip lash trying to chew it. So the wings were bad the cheese steak had vertually no cheese and had a lot of grizzle in the meat. This was our last trip to this place.",

Well that turned into 10 minutes and when my cheesesteak was done I saw my fries had been setting for that entire time. Of course when I got home 15 minutes later the fries were cold and mushy. If the cheesesteak had any cheese in it I sure didn't taste any or see any. Very disappointed. Will be a long time before and if I order food from there again.",

The fries got me heated though; unlike me, they were stone cold, dry, and flavorless. Unless they step up their game, definitely would not recommend.",

The waitress got alittle snippy when she asked how everything was when I politely told her, she asked, other than that she was a good waitress and the food was still good. Now I know things are bad but if your paying 20 dollars for a dinner you expect more, maybe they were running low on chicken and sausage ü§î Can't wait for TOSCOS ITALIAN RESTAURANT to open, hope it's not much longer",

Nicely done, only complaint toast points a little thick cut.\n\nThen I had the lobster ravioli, with Ceasar salad, very good. Nice sauce.\n\nThe appetizer and main course came out way too fast, following each other immediately. I understand it's slow, but still watch ticket times.....\n\nGot a bruschetta chicken sandwich to go, chicken was dry, sandwich looked like a train wreck.\n\nAll in all, I would return when I come back to Pennsylvania.",

The roll tasted stale.  The sandwich was very, very dry to the point of being hard to swallow.  Tasted and looked like it had very little oil.  I had to add some of my own.  You had to actually hunt for the lettuce and onions.  No taste at all.  It was very bland.  The last time I got one the experience was very similar.  I suggest unless you order pizza to find another place for your sandwich.",

When we got our food we could see that the wings looked very very well done, took a bite and they were hard and very dry and chewy, not good at all, we could not eat them. Next up was the cheese steak, 1st thing I noticed was didn't look like there was any cheese on this cheese steak, I put my readers on to have a closer look searching for any traces of cheese, after searching I finally found a tiny bit of cheese on the one half of the steak. Took a few bites and the meat had a lot of grizzle in it which I had to spit out   cause my jaw was having whip lash trying to chew it. So the wings were bad the cheese steak had vertually no cheese and had a lot of grizzle in the meat. This was our last trip to this place.",
