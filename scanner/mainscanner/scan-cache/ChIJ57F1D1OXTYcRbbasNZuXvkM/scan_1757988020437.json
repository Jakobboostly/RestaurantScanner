We ordered a brownie, lemon bar, M&M chocolate chip cookie and a piece of carrot cake. All of them were less than mediocre. The lemon bar had very little flavor. They carrot cake had more frosting and bland cream cheese layers than anything. The cake was crumbly and dry. My kids would not finish the brownie or cookie. Atmosphere was really cool üòé and the people working there were very friendly.\nToo bad the dessert was blah.",

The shop has a warm and inviting atmosphere, with exposed brick walls, well-lit windows, and eclectic art on the walls. The staff is friendly and accommodating, and they are always happy to help you find the perfect cup of coffee.\n\nIf you're looking for a great cup of coffee in a warm and inviting atmosphere, I would recommend stopping by. I grabbed a rooibos tea and treat on the way home. (Also a fun art print for cheap)",

          "text": "I really want to give this place a better review because there is a lot of potential this place could have. I have never had a positive experience between Gurus and Enliten Cafe. I never go there by choice I only go there if friends or family want to go. Unfortunarly, in the span of a week the company I was with on two separate occasions wanted to go here. The first time I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and was pretty disappointed how it was made. Its pretty obvious they use minute rice. There were next to no beans on the dish as well. Are they that cheap!? Waaaay too much cheese on top, I can see the potential of this dish had they used better ingredients and less cheese as well as better quality of cheese. It is clear that only laziness, cutting corners to save money, and carelessness went into making the dish.  The second occasion I went I ordered the Benny. I waited OVER 40 MINUTES to get my meal in a cafe that only had 4 people in it at 9am. The place was not busy whatsoever. There were at least 5 employees NOT one even cared to check up on us. Finally after getting pretty frustrated I went and waited on someone to help me at the front counter. After the 2 emoloyees got done with their conversation one of them finally approached me. I said I had been waiting a very long time for my meal and people that had showed up well after me were recieving their meals. I'm pretty frustrated I did not get compensated for the time they wasted out of my morning. I'm even more frustrated about the overall lack of professionalism and laziness of the business. Whoever manages this place you really need to step it up. It really amazes me that I waited that long and if I hadn't gone to check on my food who knows how much longer I would have waited. Instruct your employess on customer service perhaps instruct yourself too. It's a SERVICE oriented business...2 solid thumbs down. I regret tipping beforehand.",

          "text": "Apr 2018 Edit: The last time I went, I got half a sandwich and a small cup of tomato basil soup. (the cup is smaller than a bowl). When I asked the server to double check to see if they were supposed to only give me a cup he told me yes. I was very upset as a couple months ago I was told that a \"half and half\" combo meal means a sandwich and a BOWL of soup, not a CUP.\n\nI feel that for only half a sandwich (not even a full sandwich I'm supposed to have) and a cup of soup,  $12 is a steep price to pay. I will probably never go back.\n-------\nI come here almost every Friday. They are slightly pricey for soup and sandwich, but this is the Best Tomato Basil soup I have ever had. The artisan foccia bread on their sandwich is a little dry, but that's fixed with dipping it in to the soup. The inside of the sandwich (caprese cheese) is A plus. I also love their cobb salad. So 4 stars on the food.\n\nHowever, I don't stay for the food. I stay for the atmosphere and the ambience of the cafe. And the half price bakery goods after 5. I love the free WiFi, and if nothing strikes your food fancy, you can also order from Guru's at the Enliten counter. 5 stars for atmosphere.\n\nProbably a 3.5 for service. Sometimes I've ordered a combo, yet got a tiny cup of soup rather than a bowl. I know better now, but when it happened I was confused but went with it. Sometimes theb staff seem confused on what you do or do not have, even though you have a number sign.\n\n(As an aside, they have diet dr. pepper!!)",

Worse, still, I specifically ordered a dairy-free hot chocolate since I am lactose intolerant. The hot chocolate was delicious, but ten minutes after I got home, I spent the next 30 minutes vomiting my entire meal, which only happens after I consume dairy. I try not to be too picky at restaurants, but both requests I'd made at my last visit were ignored.",

          "text": "Co-Located with Guru's Cafe in Provo, it shares some of the same aesthetics.  I \"checked in\" on YELP at Guru's when we had dinner there and was \"rewarded\" with a coupon for a \"free cookie\" from Enliten Bakery.  Normally, I don't accept gifts or discounts from places I review unless it is a printed coupon anyone can use and this offer seemed close enough to that standard to give it a try.  Also, living hundreds of miles away there was not likely another opportunity to use it later.  Generally, my view is if I wouldn't buy something, getting it for free with a coupon is \"no great deal.\"\n\nIt was a busy day for the hard working crew at Enlighten and Guru's and it was also within an hour of their closing.  After enjoying a very good dinner I went to the bakery counter to find out what my coupon could redeem?  They had a single peanut butter cookie left which had a corner broken off, some sugar cookies, and some gluten-free cookies, one each of chocolate chip, the other was Snickerdoodle. Of all of these the broken peanut butter cookie was the most appealing to me and sugar cookies the least. I also thought to myself I'll take \"the damaged one\" so they can sell the others.  The nice lady grabbed it with tongs and just add she tried to put it in a bag with them the cookie fell to the floor.  She was mortified.  She asked if I wanted a suggest cookie instead and I explained that would not go over well with my wife who would be sharing it with me.  She then offered the two remaining gluten-free cookies, which I accepted. The grace she handled this with is more noteworthy than the cookies.\n\nThey were good, even two days later when we enjoyed them with decaf enhanced with a little Irish Cream back at home.\n\nThe bakery also had Sweet Potato Cheesecake which really intrigued me but I didn't have room for after our meal from Guru's and our would not have kept well during our drive back to Cheyenne the next day.\n\nWhile we were still a at the bakery,  I  \"checked in\" on YELP and... got another coupon for a \"free cookie\".  The next time were there I'm not going to use it. Instead, I'm going to leave room for desert and try a slice of that Sweet Potato (or some other) cheesecake. üòÅ\n\nBon App√©tit üòÄ",
