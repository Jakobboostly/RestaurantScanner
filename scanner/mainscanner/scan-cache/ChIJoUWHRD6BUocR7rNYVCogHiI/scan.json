The smoked red pepper tzatziki was great (a little spicy) and the lamb and beef were a little dry from sitting in the metal tins. I wish they fresh cut the meat! We all agreed the tzatziki sauce would have been better if it was under or mixed with the meat. Overall flavor was good with fresh toppings to choose from. The baklava was okay, nothing special but sweet. Would come back but would definitely mix that tzatziki in with the meat to help how dry it can get. The chicken was nice and moist though! I also think you should get more than 3 topping choices. I wanted lettuce too.",

          "text": "Got a side of meat with two toppings. I chose chicken and gyro meat. The chicken was thigh meat that still had quite a bit of fat throughout. The gyro meat was unremarkable and fairly bland compared to other Greek places'.  Both selections were cold despite being pulled from warming pans.\nStaff was very helpful and friendly. They were both working hard. The person who was serving actually recommended the side option to make my pocketbook happy. I avoid carbs and the side was exactly perfect for what I needed for both nutritional value and size. My spouse got the house Gyro with chicken and Gyro as well. We arrived around 7 pm Nd they were in process of closing. Chairs were on tables, silverware etc restocked and they were mopping the floors. Staff was welcoming and kind and didn't make us feel like were in the way. I may give it another chance if I can get there earlier in the day. Would definitely not order the chicken again because it was fatty and dry. The food service area needed to be wiped up but things get messy when it's busy and perhaps they didn't have a chance to make it neat. The floor was sticky throughout the dining area despite watching it get mopped. Overall, the food was OK, the staff were kind and helpful.",

The gyro meat was unremarkable and fairly bland compared to other Greek places'.  Both selections were cold despite being pulled from warming pans.\nStaff was very helpful and friendly. They were both working hard. The person who was serving actually recommended the side option to make my pocketbook happy. I avoid carbs and the side was exactly perfect for what I needed for both nutritional value and size. My spouse got the house Gyro with chicken and Gyro as well. We arrived around 7 pm Nd they were in process of closing. Chairs were on tables, silverware etc restocked and they were mopping the floors. Staff was welcoming and kind and didn't make us feel like were in the way. I may give it another chance if I can get there earlier in the day. Would definitely not order the chicken again because it was fatty and dry. The food service area needed to be wiped up but things get messy when it's busy and perhaps they didn't have a chance to make it neat. The floor was sticky throughout the dining area despite watching it get mopped. Overall, the food was OK, the staff were kind and helpful.",

Feta cheese counts for a topping which is kind of dumb because then you‚Äôre left with some very lack luster fillings apparently. I just think it‚Äôs crazy that they give you a minuscule amount of toppings when you only get 3 of them. They gave me enough Taziki sauce to bathe in but no feta and TWO OLIVES. The dude was super rude and the food was fine. But I‚Äôll probably never go there again because $10 for a bowl of rice with some fancy sour cream on top is crazy. The drink setup was cool though.",

I quickly noticed all of the employees had earbuds in, no wonder nobody greeted us. There has to be some sort of Health Code that violates. To top it off, when we went to pay, she just pulled it up on the screen and then walked away. I payed and had to reach around the register to even grab my food. The food tasted good, but the service is what will keep us from returning in the future.",

However, tonight was literally the most disgusting experience I've had at Padeli's and I will likely not be back. Maybe it's my fault for having arrived 30-40 minutes before closing. To start, we ordered our food, they didn't have enough rice for one of the bowls so they took my bowl to the back and filled it from who knows where. Then they added feta cheese to our bowl, but before doing so they noticed a spoon in the feta cheese container that shouldn't of been there and proceeded to take it out and put it where they believed it went, instead of grabbing a new utensil. Then I added an order of the pita chips and dip and asked for tzatziki sauce as the dip, which the had none left in the container, so they scraped the edges and bottom several times in order to fill one small dip container, that was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!! Can't believe I still paid and tipped these two girls for this kind of service. Then to top it all off, the soda machine was off or not working and had to be reset in order for us to get one soft drink, all of this going on while they were cleaning around us and sweeping, which I understand it's close to closing time, but do you realize while you're sweeping, there are particles possibly from your entire shift going into the air and into our food and drink??? None the less we paid for our food but we are now up the road at Spitz where they actually have customers there and the service so far has been better.\n\nEDIT: In response to the owners reply, it may have been \"one instance\" for me, but upon further review of reviews left by other customers, this definitely isn't the first time this has happened. Honestly I just hope this is something you discuss with your staff again to prevent any further returning customers from deciding to not come back due to this repeated type of incident.",
