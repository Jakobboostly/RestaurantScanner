The recommended special was amazing (Peruvian chicken) the chicken was flavorful and tender and the Betsy Bowl was really good with their fresh made pasta sauce. I've been making pasta for years with fresh sauce and I dare say it's one of the best I've had in utah as well. Will definitely be eating here again!",

We were quickly greeted by the chef who made some food recommendations and the host was great at suggesting some of the mocktails on the menu. As we were waiting for our food, I was really impressed by the atmosphere, basically feeling like a more ‚Äúgentle‚Äù bar scene social setting with great live music. When the food came I honestly did not expect the impressive presentation and the food was delicious. Everything tasted really high quality and fresh.

She didn‚Äôt say a word when she left it on the table.  Not knowing what the other people in my party had ordered, we all started digging in as we were sharing all of our other food. Both the owner and the ‚Äúco-owner‚Äù came back demanding we pay for the second crepe, yelling at us. Telling us ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt do something like that‚Äù and how dishonest we were.

Maybe the food is better and service is faster when it‚Äôs the evening rush and it was just an error on our part to go for lunch when there were only a couple of other people there, but it took a looooong time to get food that should have been warm but was instead cold.",

            "text": "Very disappointed. Been a fan of the atmosphere, dessert, and events held here, but I will not be returning. Given they serve spirit free tequila shots and began serving alcohol recently, we assumed they served alcoholic shots too (god forbid). After trying to order shots the owner angrily exclaims ‚Äúthis is not ABG‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a restaurant. We do not sell shots here‚Äù. I appreciated the information since I previously thought of The Social as a dry bar (like The Wash) rather than a restaurant, that‚Äôs on me, but it was an honest mistake. Instead of showcasing what they do sell, he was impatient, harsh, and so tense the whole restaurant stopped to watch. I would‚Äôve been glad to order one of their cool drinks and desserts instead, but the interaction was v uncomfortable and unwelcoming, we left speechless.",
