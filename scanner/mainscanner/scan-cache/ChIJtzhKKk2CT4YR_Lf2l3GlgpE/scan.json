I wish the sandwiches had some other veggie than onions and meat.\n\nI wouldn't return. Its a Saturday night and this place has been empty from 6-8p.

For other first timers: you go in and order at a counter, they'll give you your cups and then you pick a table and they'll call your name when your food is ready. They have the menu on the wall but also hand held sheets so you can stand to the side and make up your mind. The food was good, the men making the plates were friendly and you get plenty for your money (I ate twice from my portion). Our only small issue was that the lady that took our order didn't want the experienced person to order lamb. Maybe they were out or running low, but he gave his order and she kept repeating a version of: pork is our traditional meat, pork is the traditional order, etc , and by the third time she said it, he gave in and ordered the pork, then during the meal he said that having had them both now, he should have insisted on the lamb. It won't keep us from returning, it was just a little odd.",

The soup i order had too much vinegar or acidity, I only ate one spoonful. The gyro sandwich was OK, but the pita bread here is like a loaf, its way to big and thick. I wish the sandwiches had some other veggie than onions and meat.\n\nI wouldn't return. Its a Saturday night and this place has been empty from 6-8p. That says alit about what people think about this place. But go try it for yourself.",

For other first timers: you go in and order at a counter, they'll give you your cups and then you pick a table and they'll call your name when your food is ready. They have the menu on the wall but also hand held sheets so you can stand to the side and make up your mind. The food was good, the men making the plates were friendly and you get plenty for your money (I ate twice from my portion). Our only small issue was that the lady that took our order didn't want the experienced person to order lamb. Maybe they were out or running low, but he gave his order and she kept repeating a version of: pork is our traditional meat, pork is the traditional order, etc , and by the third time she said it, he gave in and ordered the pork, then during the meal he said that having had them both now, he should have insisted on the lamb. It won't keep us from returning, it was just a little odd.",
