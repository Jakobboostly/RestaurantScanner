          "text": "I've ordered delivery from here about 7 or so times now, each time the food is fantastic. Had the cheesesteak twice, individual pizza slices twice, and a meatball sub. Whole pizzas the rest of the time, every time it's really great pizza. I keep it simple with just cheese and pepperoni, the sauce is really good it's not too thick  and has a great actual tomato taste. Each time it's been very consistent with is great, I know what I'm getting and it's going to be tasty.\n\nIt's really cool to see places doing by the slice again, it wasn't something offered a lot of times but has been making a come back. All the food is great it's never been a bad experience, the subs are probably about 12 inches maybe 14. Never lasted long enough for me to care to get a tape measure and the pricing for delivery is very reasonable.\n\nEDIT: I think I got the brownie from here, it was good.",

          "text": "I brought a 14 inch pepperoni pizza with a brownie and it wasn‚Äôt bad. The pizza did have a unique taste and that is what makes it good and very different. I didn‚Äôt even have to ask for extra pepperoni or get a bit annoyed because there wasn‚Äôt enough pepperoni due to past experiences with pizzerias not giving enough pepperoni. The sauce wasn‚Äôt much and there was more cheese than sauce but that is what makes the pizza unique and the pizza wasn‚Äôt one of those high rising kinds which I find a bit unnecessary. Now the brownie, it was crunchy and creamy and sweet, but I shouldn‚Äôt expect any less because a brownie is a sweet, but anyways the brownie wasn‚Äôt what I thought it would be, but it wasn‚Äôt bad, just crunchy and creamy. I might come back as this was my first time trying out this place.",

          "text": "The food was subpar for the price.  A five cheese pizza with barely any cheese, a bacon chicken ranch pizza was very dry and did not taste like ranch.  The chicken parm. sub had no flavor (especially the sauce).  The French fries and onion rings were soggy and cold.  The ultimate chocolate cake seemed like it had sat in their refrigerator for weeks, because the icing was hard.  I was told it would be an hour for the delivery that took an hour and 45 minutes to arrive.  $100 with tip definitely not going to waste that kind of money on subpar food.  I can normally tell if a restaurant has good food if they have a good chicken parm., but this was the first and last time I will be getting food from here.",

I didn‚Äôt even have to ask for extra pepperoni or get a bit annoyed because there wasn‚Äôt enough pepperoni due to past experiences with pizzerias not giving enough pepperoni. The sauce wasn‚Äôt much and there was more cheese than sauce but that is what makes the pizza unique and the pizza wasn‚Äôt one of those high rising kinds which I find a bit unnecessary. Now the brownie, it was crunchy and creamy and sweet, but I shouldn‚Äôt expect any less because a brownie is a sweet, but anyways the brownie wasn‚Äôt what I thought it would be, but it wasn‚Äôt bad, just crunchy and creamy.

My wife asked me a couple of times to try this place, and I told her any place named \"The Great Pizza Company\" is not gonna have a good pie. Don't let the name fool you! I finally tried it and was pleasantly surprised. (Apologies to the owner, but I hate the name, it delayed me stopping by and giving it a shot). I loved it, and it's now my go-to place to pick up great pizza and garlic knots. Both are the best around. Please don't make a \"new and improved\" sauce!! LOL.",

They're higher in price than your typical big-pizza-chain but in my opinion, 100% justified when you taste the difference. It's always so fresh and they have really creative pizza combinations. They also have a budget friendly lunch special with huge slices. 10/10 recommend!",

I respect the hustle !\nIt‚Äôs relaxing to eat there and just hangout for a bit and take your time to reset and take a breather. Also, you can get (2) big slices and a drink which is a FULL meal and leave a tip for about $15 which is totally worth the food and experience. The 18‚Äù pizza could be a full meal for (4) people\nIt is on par with Chesapeake Pizza if not better , sometimes I go to Chesapeake Pizza and they can be off sometimes . Great Pizza is more consistent I‚Äôd have to say",

I've had service from then over a hundred times. They pretty much know what I want and when I call most of the time I don't even have to say my phone number.

The store was willing to refund the extra money I spent on a topping I didn't receive, which is good, but because of my reaction to red onions, I could not eat the pizza myself. I was told the pizza flavor was okay but needed more sauce. I'm sure the pizza is better warm, so dining in may be better.",

The chicken parm. sub had no flavor (especially the sauce).  The French fries and onion rings were soggy and cold.  The ultimate chocolate cake seemed like it had sat in their refrigerator for weeks, because the icing was hard.  I was told it would be an hour for the delivery that took an hour and 45 minutes to arrive.  $100 with tip definitely not going to waste that kind of money on subpar food.  I can normally tell if a restaurant has good food if they have a good chicken parm., but this was the first and last time I will be getting food from here.",
