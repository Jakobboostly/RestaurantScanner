          "text": "The Old Irving Park Leona's location took over the Tahina Kitchen space. Shifting from an incredible Middle Eastern, quality food and service restaurant, to a sub-par pizza place, absolutely Unworthy of the long standing Leona's name and reputation. Overall experience: Horrible. I just raised my cholesterol numbers for REALLY BAD food.\n\nI was very hopeful for the new Old Irving Park location, as I grew up eating at various Leona's in Chicago. I placed an order today as a treat for myself and a break from my healthy eating pattern.  Before I could do so, a pop up for \"Club Rewards\" popped up, so I entered my phone number and immediately saw a \"Free Cheese Pizza\" for signing up. However,  when I picked up my order from the rude guy behind the register, I showed him the pop up and explained I tried to enter the code and it wouldn't work. He quickly said \"we aren't doing that anymore, too many people kept clicking on it...\" I told him they needed to take it off their website, as that is false advertising. He did not respond.  Not \"I'm  sorry about that,\" or \"I'll let my boss know.\" No response, he just stood there staring at me.\n\nI ordered the Italian Beef Egg Rolls and Brick Mozzarella Sticks. The Brick Mozzarella sticks were incredible growing up, the ones I got today, were inedible. The batter used for the outside reminded me of a hard, tasteless, corn flake. I have no idea what they are using now, but the outside of the Mozzarella Brick was bizarre, the texture was really unpleasant, I'm surprised I didn't chip a tooth. The Italian Beef Egg Rolls (2 in the order what??) Were also unpleasant as one of them was burned. Flavor was lacking.\n\nOther reviewers have also had similar experiences here. My guess is this Leona's location won't last long. Its too bad, they used to have good food and service. I won't be going back.",

Did a thin half/half and toppings for half the pizza costs the same as the whole pizza. You'd think that meant they would do a lot more topping but no, it's the average amount of toppings. What was NOT average was the pathetic amount of spinach I got in my stuffed pizza. There was almost nothing in there.",

There are much better pizza places in the area like chicago pizza. La villa and others.  The rating they were getting. The rating For this restaurant is way blown out of proportion. These restaurants should be reviewed, so they show a current level of rating. I posted 2 photos of their crappy food quality.  They will continue to be posted. That is a $20 calamari in photo.

          "text": "I think Old Irving needed a quick pizza/pasta place like this. I tried a sausage thin crust, spaghetti with meat sauce, and a Detroit style with pepperoni. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt order the Detroit style again. The edges were crispy, but it was just okay. The spaghetti and meat sauce were good, but it‚Äôs spaghetti and meat sauce so don‚Äôt expect anything crazy. The winner was the sausage thin crust. It wasn‚Äôt too cheesy, which is what I like, and the crust was a great mix between crispy and easy to chew. The amount of sauce was perfect. Not too little (like some places), but enough to actually taste it. I know some other reviews from here say to avoid toppings, but I thought the sausage was good. I will definitely get the thin crust again.",

The quality of the pizza was top-notch, and you could tell it was made with care.\n\nWhat truly set this experience apart was the outstanding service. The delivery driver went above and beyond‚Äînot only was he incredibly hospitable, but he also helped me set up the catering order. That level of service is rare and deserves recognition!\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for amazing pizza, appetizers and exceptional customer service, Leona‚Äôs Pizzeria is the place to go.

It should have been a bright orange.  Either that keg has been sitting there for way too long, or they don‚Äôt take care of their beer lines.  My wife got wine, and it was also disgusting.\n\nThen the waiter carried our drinks over in his arms against his sweaty shirt.  Just gross.  That‚Äôs why they should have serving trays.  He also just didn‚Äôt seem to know what this place had to offer, either with food or drinks.\n\nFinally, the pizza just wasn‚Äôt good.  For a pizza place I‚Äôd definitely expect better, especially with all the other options in the area.  It tasted like a ‚ÄúChicago pizza‚Äù we‚Äôd get in Florida.\n\nOverall, it was one of the worst dining experiences I‚Äôve had in the area, and we definitely won‚Äôt be back.",

I really don't think anybody should ever go there. This is such a poor showing on this restaurant that had a history, but no longer has. The people answering the phone are rude worthless scum.  There are much better pizza places in the area like chicago pizza. La villa and others.  The rating they were getting. The rating For this restaurant is way blown out of proportion. These restaurants should be reviewed, so they show a current level of rating. I posted 2 photos of their crappy food quality.  They will continue to be posted. That is a $20 calamari in photo.

The casual, welcoming atmosphere makes it a perfect spot for a family meal or a laid-back dinner with friends. Overall, a reliable neighborhood choice.",

          "text": "I was disappointed with my recent visit to this restaurant. Despite the high ratings, it seems those reviews might be biased or written by friends of the owners. The service was lacking, especially considering I was the only customer in the restaurant at the time.\n\nThe payment system raised some concerns, and the responses to negative reviews from the restaurant's management did not inspire confidence. Their suggestion that asking for a menu is a \"secret\" is puzzling and not helpful.\n\nAdditionally, while they advertise themselves as a carryout restaurant, the large dining room seems to contradict that claim. It feels like they‚Äôre trying to downplay the lack of dine-in customers.\n\nI anticipate that this review will receive a defense response because whoever replies to this has no experience with customer relations. Just remember the customer is always right not what you think is right. The one good thing about this restaurant is that there is always parking because no one eats here. Or just use the parking lot to park and go somewhere else.",

No one was there to greet us, after a few minutes, a guy came out of the bathroom and asked if we are dining in or taking out. We said dining in and he said we can sit anywhere. He then asked if I knew how to use a QR code and I said yes. He said the water station is over there and you can help yourself. We sat down and my partner went to get water. The water had floating particles in it, and it wasn't the lemon water either. After that, we decided to leave and left a $5 tip. Now here is what we experienced.\n\n1. Walked in and it smelled like old funky musty mopping water\n2. No one in front to greet guests\n3. Self Service: sit yourself, get your own water, get your plates and utensils.\n4. Water had particles floating in it.\n5. Scan QR Code, Pre-pay for your meal, 18% gratuity charge for self service.\n6. No music, unwelcoming, smelly, must pre-pay and over priced for self service.\n\nMaybe delivery is the way to go as this seems to be a common issue here.\n\nTip: If people come to Leonas, they want the old Leonas experience. Not a watered down App ordering self service experience like McDonalds.",

            "text": "I think Old Irving needed a quick pizza/pasta place like this. I tried a sausage thin crust, spaghetti with meat sauce, and a Detroit style with pepperoni. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt order the Detroit style again. The edges were crispy, but it was just okay. The spaghetti and meat sauce were good, but it‚Äôs spaghetti and meat sauce so don‚Äôt expect anything crazy. The winner was the sausage thin crust. It wasn‚Äôt too cheesy, which is what I like, and the crust was a great mix between crispy and easy to chew. The amount of sauce was perfect. Not too little (like some places), but enough to actually taste it. I know some other reviews from here say to avoid toppings, but I thought the sausage was good. I will definitely get the thin crust again.",

I also ordered some calamari but unfortunately it was very rubbery and uneatable so I had to throw it away.  Hoping this place gets better as I was a fan of this place.",

            "text": "The Old Irving Park Leona's location took over the Tahina Kitchen space. Shifting from an incredible Middle Eastern, quality food and service restaurant, to a sub-par pizza place, absolutely Unworthy of the long standing Leona's name and reputation. Overall experience: Horrible. I just raised my cholesterol numbers for REALLY BAD food.\n\nI was very hopeful for the new Old Irving Park location, as I grew up eating at various Leona's in Chicago. I placed an order today as a treat for myself and a break from my healthy eating pattern.  Before I could do so, a pop up for \"Club Rewards\" popped up, so I entered my phone number and immediately saw a \"Free Cheese Pizza\" for signing up. However,  when I picked up my order from the rude guy behind the register, I showed him the pop up and explained I tried to enter the code and it wouldn't work. He quickly said \"we aren't doing that anymore, too many people kept clicking on it...\" I told him they needed to take it off their website, as that is false advertising. He did not respond.  Not \"I'm  sorry about that,\" or \"I'll let my boss know.\" No response, he just stood there staring at me.\n\nI ordered the Italian Beef Egg Rolls and Brick Mozzarella Sticks. The Brick Mozzarella sticks were incredible growing up, the ones I got today, were inedible. The batter used for the outside reminded me of a hard, tasteless, corn flake. I have no idea what they are using now, but the outside of the Mozzarella Brick was bizarre, the texture was really unpleasant, I'm surprised I didn't chip a tooth. The Italian Beef Egg Rolls (2 in the order what??) Were also unpleasant as one of them was burned. Flavor was lacking.\n\nOther reviewers have also had similar experiences here. My guess is this Leona's location won't last long. Its too bad, they used to have good food and service. I won't be going back.",
