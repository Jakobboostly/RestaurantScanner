Twice there was sausage instead of pepperoni so we waited half an hour for the correct pizza to be made and went back to the store and picked it up.  Tonight - 3rd time!!! Pick up the pizza and the Chicago style sauce is not on the pizza. Chicago style sauce costs extra. From the manager on duty we got take the pizza or wait 25 minutes for another pizza to be made. It‚Äôs 8 pm, we already waited 45 minutes before we could pick up our pizza. I‚Äôm not going to sit there for another half hour for another pizza to be made. I don‚Äôt eat plain pepperoni pizza so we came home with a pizza we paid extra for (the sauce) and no offer of refund- even for the sauce that is missing!  Ridiculous - don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll go back. What‚Äôs the point to be loyal when you‚Äôre treated like it‚Äôs not their problem when the order is wrong?!  We had patience the first two times - now my patience is gone.",

          "text": "$45 for a large four topping pizza?! I was blown away during my recent visit that a pizza could be so expensive. We‚Äôve been coming to Panhandler‚Äôs‚Äòs pizza in northern Colorado and more specifically Fort Collins Colorado for more than 30 years. The original location at campus west was a unique blend of quality pizza, great service, and a fantastic atmosphere. the pizza is still fantastic and probably the best pizza in all of Fort Collins if you‚Äôre looking for the classic deep dish. However, during my most recent visit to the newer location in mid town, Fort Collins, not only was I shocked at the price of the pizza, I was shocked at the number of dirty tables with dishes piled up on them throughout the entire restaurant. I would say about 90% of the tables were dirty and had not been cleaned. There was one person working behind the counter, taking orders, and responsible for keeping the front of the house clean. I understand that food cost is high right now but $45 for a pizza is way too much. I‚Äôd like to say that we will continue to go here for Pizza but given the previous experience I‚Äôm not so sure that we will. I give a five star rating for the awesome pizza.",

It's supposed to be thick with cheese and sausage, not half cooked dough üòí üòï.  Also, they charge 53 cents for a small container of ranch, and it's only half full. 70 dollars for a below average pizza, a salad, and cheese bread.  There are many better options for pizza close by unless you can't eat without the folks singing there.",

          "text": "I have been a loyal patron of Panhandlers since the 1990‚Äôs. The last three times we have ordered pizza - the same pizza we always order it has been wrong. Twice there was sausage instead of pepperoni so we waited half an hour for the correct pizza to be made and went back to the store and picked it up.  Tonight - 3rd time!!! Pick up the pizza and the Chicago style sauce is not on the pizza. Chicago style sauce costs extra. From the manager on duty we got take the pizza or wait 25 minutes for another pizza to be made. It‚Äôs 8 pm, we already waited 45 minutes before we could pick up our pizza. I‚Äôm not going to sit there for another half hour for another pizza to be made. I don‚Äôt eat plain pepperoni pizza so we came home with a pizza we paid extra for (the sauce) and no offer of refund- even for the sauce that is missing!  Ridiculous - don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll go back. What‚Äôs the point to be loyal when you‚Äôre treated like it‚Äôs not their problem when the order is wrong?!  We had patience the first two times - now my patience is gone.",

          "text": "Some places are special not just because of the food, but because of the memories, the stories, and the moments they hold. Panhandler‚Äôs Pizza is exactly that kind of place.\n\nFor my partner, Lauren, this has been her favorite pizza since childhood‚Äîa place where she shared meals, laughter, and stories with her grandparents, parents, friends, and now our own family. This kind of nostalgia is rare, and finding a restaurant that carries the weight of so many years of love and tradition is something truly priceless.\n\nBut let‚Äôs be clear‚Äîit‚Äôs not just nostalgia; the pizza is absolutely delicious. My most recent visit was just this week. I stopped in to pick up a few slices to go for the family and while waiting, I ordered a local beer (because that‚Äôs all they serve, and I love that detail). The staff was friendly, welcoming, and exactly the kind of people you want running a place with this much history. When I got home, we opened up the box, and there it was‚Äîthe same incredible pizza Lauren has loved her whole life, still as amazing as ever.\n\nShe asked me, ‚ÄúIs the pizza really that good, or do you think it‚Äôs the nostalgia that makes me love it so much?‚Äù\n\nMy answer? It‚Äôs both. A place like this wouldn‚Äôt have lasted since 1975 if the pizza wasn‚Äôt exceptional, and the pizza wouldn‚Äôt taste quite as magical if it didn‚Äôt come with the memories. It‚Äôs the perfect match of flavor and feeling, and that‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt fake.\n\nPlaces like Panhandler‚Äôs Pizza don‚Äôt just happen every day‚Äîthey are cherished, legendary, and one-of-a-kind. If you‚Äôve never been, you‚Äôre missing out on one of the most special pizza experiences you‚Äôll ever have.",

I‚Äôve been there several times and it has always been the same‚Ä¶polite & knowledgeable folks behind the counter. They have pizza by the slice under warming lights. As we all know that can be problematic depending on how long the pizza has been sitting there. It‚Äôs no different at Panhandler‚Äôs. At Panhandler‚Äôs you can rest assured that the pizza has not been sitting for hours because they refuse to serve you any pizza that has been under the lights for too long.\nWhilst the folks there are marvelous, the star of the show is their pizza. I have traveled this entire country - every state but Hawaii. I have traveled into Canada mainland and surrounding islands. In the navy, I sailed up and down the east coast from Puerto Rico & Cuba down south to Nova Scotia and other places up North. I sailed all over the Mediterranean, stopping in Italy, France, Greece & Northern Africa just to name a few. More than a dozen countries. I have eaten pizza in every country and most ports we visited. I have eaten pizza for better than 60 years and I‚Äôm telling you, Panhandler‚Äôs Pizza is the best I‚Äôve ever eaten! Bar none. Why you ask? To begin with all the ingredients are prepared in-house‚Ä¶fresh cheese grated every morning. Fresh vegetables cut and prepared every morning. The dough they use? You guessed it! Prepared in-house along with the pizza sauce! That, my friends, makes all the difference in the world. But this would all be for naught if it wasn‚Äôt prepared correctly. The preparation - putting it together with an abundance of toppings and then cooking it to absolute perfection is the standard operating procedure, day in and day out. It has never varied from this norm every time I‚Äôve been there. If you love pizza like I do, you owe it to yourself to go to Panhandler‚Äôs Pizza and try their pizza. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",

The person on the phone said 35 to 40 mins to pick up.\nI walked in 45 mins later and my pizza still wasn't ready.  Took another 10 mins before I received my order.   Here is the kicker.\nI always  leave a 20% tip,  cause I know restaurant workers work hard.\nWithout my tip, 2 medium pizzas costed me $56 give or take some change.\n\nPizza was not bad, but it wasn't the greatest,  nor worth the price.",
