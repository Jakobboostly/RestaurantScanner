Let me tell you about The House Special‚Äîa pizza so loaded with meat that it‚Äôs practically a structural engineering marvel. Seriously, they must be losing money on every pie. You take one bite, and you can almost hear the other pizza joints in town weeping. This pizza is so good that if Trump catches wind, he‚Äôll build a wall around it and make Domino‚Äôs pay for it.\n\nShout-out to Jayden, our server, who made the meal even better by spending extra time chatting with us and making us feel like family. And props to Joey, the owner, who shared the fascinating history behind their family-run restaurant empire. It‚Äôs clear that Pagliai‚Äôs isn‚Äôt just serving pizza‚Äîthey‚Äôre serving tradition, passion, and an experience you won‚Äôt forget.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt been yet, go. You‚Äôll leave with a full stomach, a smile, and a sense that you just tasted greatness. Also, bring a big appetite‚Ä¶ and maybe a forklift for all that meat.\n\nTell them Lance sent you, and you will get a kiss from Joey.",

So before you  have them cater your wedding and think you will wait 2 weeks before to give final numbers to them as they told us to ,you may not have any food done by them as they have zero  communication within the building.

Well glad we did as they told us sorry can't do it now we booked another wedding that day. So before you  have them cater your wedding and think you will wait 2 weeks before to give final numbers to them as they told us to ,you may not have any food done by them as they have zero  communication within the building.  Someone failed there.\nHave gave them the last of my business.  Will no longer spend my money eating here.",

Let me tell you about The House Special‚Äîa pizza so loaded with meat that it‚Äôs practically a structural engineering marvel. Seriously, they must be losing money on every pie. You take one bite, and you can almost hear the other pizza joints in town weeping. This pizza is so good that if Trump catches wind, he‚Äôll build a wall around it and make Domino‚Äôs pay for it.\n\nShout-out to Jayden, our server, who made the meal even better by spending extra time chatting with us and making us feel like family. And props to Joey, the owner, who shared the fascinating history behind their family-run restaurant empire. It‚Äôs clear that Pagliai‚Äôs isn‚Äôt just serving pizza‚Äîthey‚Äôre serving tradition, passion, and an experience you won‚Äôt forget.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt been yet, go. You‚Äôll leave with a full stomach, a smile, and a sense that you just tasted greatness. Also, bring a big appetite‚Ä¶ and maybe a forklift for all that meat.\n\nTell them Lance sent you, and you will get a kiss from Joey.",

Let me tell you about The House Special‚Äîa pizza so loaded with meat that it‚Äôs practically a structural engineering marvel. Seriously, they must be losing money on every pie. You take one bite, and you can almost hear the other pizza joints in town weeping. This pizza is so good that if Trump catches wind, he‚Äôll build a wall around it and make Domino‚Äôs pay for it.\n\nShout-out to Jayden, our server, who made the meal even better by spending extra time chatting with us and making us feel like family. And props to Joey, the owner, who shared the fascinating history behind their family-run restaurant empire. It‚Äôs clear that Pagliai‚Äôs isn‚Äôt just serving pizza‚Äîthey‚Äôre serving tradition, passion, and an experience you won‚Äôt forget.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt been yet, go. You‚Äôll leave with a full stomach, a smile, and a sense that you just tasted greatness. Also, bring a big appetite‚Ä¶ and maybe a forklift for all that meat.\n\nTell them Lance sent you, and you will get a kiss from Joey.",
