I got chips and salsa they're free if you have a meal over $10 anything under you have to pay. The atmosphere was real pleasant. They had TVs and you can help yourself to the fountain drinks. Food was good. I will go back and try something else on the menu. Definitely well return.",

Twice we have ordered to go, and when we arrived home we found that food we ordered and paid for did not get put into our bag. We live outside of town so it is not convenient to return. Unfortunately this has made us feel that we will not return.",

The enchiladas were EMPTY, sauce on top with somd sprinkled cheese in top!  Beans were dry and rice had zero flavor.   My husband ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and said it was just ok.  Very disappointing for our very first and very last time eating at this restaurant.    Im actually sad to be writing this review because we ALWAYS look forward to our Friday night mexican food nights.    On top of everything thd prices are definitely higher than most places.

I was there with my wife, daughter and grandson as well as my daughter's mother-in-law and sisters-in-law. My daughter's in-laws had eaten here before and liked it, which is why we opted to eat there.\n\nThe presentation of the food was nice. It actually looked appetizing but when we started eating it, the experience went south pretty quickly. It just honestly tasted bad. It was not good at all. The molcajete was around $35 but it really didn't have $35 worth of food in it. Additionally, they used chicken thighs rather than breasts, which are cheaper, fattier and greasier than white meat. I ate about three bites and wrote the whole thing off. It was just gross and the flavors were way off. Even the salsa tasted wrong. I was told that my kid's mother in law actually complained to the staff about it but I wasn't there for it. I had to go out and reposition car seats for my grandson. I would have sent it all back but my wife didn't want to make a scene. To sum it up, it was awful, no one liked it and none of us will ever eat there again. The most irritating part of this kind of experience is that I had to drive out of my way for it and pay for it",
