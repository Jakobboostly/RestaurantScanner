Parking can be a bit tricky right on Thayer Street, but there's more available a couple of blocks away. The staff are friendly, and the extra-large pizzas are a definite plus! They have a wide variety of menu options, and the food is consistently good ‚Äì never burnt like at some other locations. It's a great spot for weekend eats, open late and serving whole pies. Plus, they have a nice dining area if you want to eat in. I had a great experience when I encountered a website glitch and the staff was super helpful in resolving it by manually adding my coupon.

We ordered the vegetarian pie topped with tomatoes, onions, olives, mushrooms, and basil. The pizza was good but not something I am used to, considering I live in NY. It seemed that the veggies were put on after the pizza was baked so they were cold while the dough, sauce, and cheese were warm. Also, some of the veggies were cut into chunks so the texture felt a little awkward.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and efficient.

I‚Äôm sure it was obvious that we were visiting for the first time and not regulars so as a tourist, I would not recommend this place at all.

          "text": "I can‚Äôt take away from their delicious pizza however this place has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My 15 year old autistic son attends a summer program at Brown University and will sometimes walk with friends over to get some lunch. My son is autistic very intelligent in most areas but gets very overwhelmed with money and purchases he doesn‚Äôt quite get the concept. He just gets so frazzled when it comes to these things. So what I do is every week put a lunch allowance on his cash app account to try to avoid the panic for him. Ithought it would be great for him to experience going with a group of friends and eating lunch which he has been doing since this program started at various restaurants near the college. Well Wednesday himself and a friend decided to go to Antonio‚Äôs for lunch well whatever they purchased came to $20.52 which is fine so my son paid with his card and it is debit so it automatically withdraws now yesterday he goes to buy a donut at the cafeteria and it was denied due to insufficient funds. Well he couldn‚Äôt figure it out so he became very overwhelmed and called me I checked his account and Antonio‚Äôs decided to go in at 4:20am yesterday and take another $20.52 cents off his card leaving him with a $2 balance (so he paid $41 for some pizza. Later that afternoon I went in and at first spoke to the most ignorant girl at the counter who proceeded to tell me it‚Äôs not their problem and my son should of checked his receipt before he left even rolling her eyes and refusing to allow me to speak to a manager well the manager finally walked in and I showed him all the account info and he took a photo and said he was sending it to his main store for them to take a look now while speaking to him the disrespectful girl on the background is still running her mouth and making faces at my son. Needless to say the manager I. So many words was telling me oh well take it as a loss. This is a well known and liked pizza spot however their customer service is awful and I feel like they took advantage of my son because number 1 he is a kid and two she could see how overwhelmed he was. So in reality they are thief‚Äôs just sad. Please if you eat here ask for double copy‚Äôs of your receipt and check it before leaving. Shame on them for taking advantage of a kid in my sons position",

          "text": "Antonio's Pizzeria on Thayer Street is a convenient spot with easy online and phone ordering, even by text. Parking can be a bit tricky right on Thayer Street, but there's more available a couple of blocks away. The staff are friendly, and the extra-large pizzas are a definite plus! They have a wide variety of menu options, and the food is consistently good ‚Äì never burnt like at some other locations. It's a great spot for weekend eats, open late and serving whole pies. Plus, they have a nice dining area if you want to eat in. I had a great experience when I encountered a website glitch and the staff was super helpful in resolving it by manually adding my coupon. Highly recommend!",

They have about at least 15 types of pizza ready by the slices. You pick it and they will warm it up if desired. My children and I wanted to try the different types so we all ordered 2 different pizza each and try each others slices. It was all good and c ollowed by a piece of their tres leche cake. They offered chocolate as well. They make whole pizza by order as well. Teachers, students, locals and more seem to migrate to this location. Not many dine in but a lot of people order to go. They come in by waves. You can tell its a popular spot.  A little pricey but delicious my children feel it's worth it and I don't disagree. I show this on my YouTube video under Sweetmommab if you want to see more",

We ordered the vegetarian pie topped with tomatoes, onions, olives, mushrooms, and basil. The pizza was good but not something I am used to, considering I live in NY. It seemed that the veggies were put on after the pizza was baked so they were cold while the dough, sauce, and cheese were warm. Also, some of the veggies were cut into chunks so the texture felt a little awkward.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Parking can be tough to find since there is no parking lot.",

No smile no hello just yelling out and slices of pizza and when asking her a question she was extremely rude. Very disappointed I have come here for over 20 years and have never experienced such bad service. We absolutely love their Pizza and have gone to other locations in Providence in Newport.",

Also ordered wings that took a while but when I politely asked if they were almost ready, the extremely rude lady at cashier respond by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yeah whatever I guess so I just came on duty‚Äù and then stared and walked away. I‚Äôm sure it was obvious that we were visiting for the first time and not regulars so as a tourist, I would not recommend this place at all. Not to mention pizza was full of grease and wings were overcooked. This review is for theThayer location visited on 7/24 at 3:15pm. Horrible experience!",
