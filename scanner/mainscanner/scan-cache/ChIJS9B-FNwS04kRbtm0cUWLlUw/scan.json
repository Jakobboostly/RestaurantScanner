My wife ate her sub mid way she spit the food out like if she saw a bug , nope. It was worse. It was pepperonis.  She started throwing up like the exorcist movie.\nHer body covered in hives,tongue had swollen ,thank the Gods we had a friend rush is a epipen. She has a meat allergy.  It was the worst I've seen. The last one was from a chinese restaurant ,ordered veggies egg rolls.  They deep fried it along with the shrimp, sheesh. Thr funny thing is. They put exactly what we ordered. It's on the receipt, so it's up to the maker to do what the order says. No meat sauce no meat pizza sub. That's it. Soooooo what's the fkn problem\nWe told them a million times no pork ever.  üòí.\n\nFew days ago we ordered pizza , took 2 hours ad 9 mins. Cold af. And no sorry, no discount nothing. We had to call.  They gave us 15.00 off pur next order . Kids wnet to bed after eating some frosted flakes, save the cold pizza for the bext day . But what's funny is our phone number was given $15.00 , then we get a sub with pork?\n\nAnyways. It's better for you to go there and order your food in person. Watch them make your food . It's the only way to get it done right. Check your food before leaving .",

I ordered some wings at noon on a Friday I get em and open the box and these things must of been refried about 8 times. They looked like someone dropped em behind the oven and they found em and slapped my name on em. The blue cheese tasted like mayo im pretty sure this was someone's old order they never picked up and best of all I had to wait 15 minutes after the 30 minutes they said it would take for em.  I work hard for my money and I feel like these dudes just got me. Prolly gunna be the last time I go there because this isn't the first time this has happened. Unfortunately I was too far up the road to take em back and my leg was busted anyway so I couldn't drive and my ride left. I was thinking about them wings all morning lol.  I won't be taking chances anymore on this place. You shouldn't either. Theres only like 2 people there that genuinely seem like they are happy you brought your business to them everyone else is chuckin the food across the shop looking like they hate you for wanting food. For what yall charge I can do better.  Its a shame cause yall was the best. I hope yall get it together.",

          "text": "Okay, My order was for a large thin pizza with cheese, pepperoni, light onions, mushrooms, and sausage. A little too salty, otherwise very good!\n\nI ordered a large pie, which I haven't done in a long time. The reasons why I wanted pizza \"Specifically\" from Mr. Pizza is simple!\nI not too long ago went to La Nova Pizzeria. How they stay in business serving up that slop, I have no idea! After eating what they call pizza, I told myself I am never eating that pizza again! I went there because they're close to where I live, and I was being lazy! On a scale of 1-10 I give La Nova's pizza about a 4.5. It's nothing great.\n\nAfter eating that slop I was really craving a much better tasting pizza and told myself \"I should have just went to Mr. Pizza!\" Here's why Mr. Pizza makes a way better tasting pizza than La Nova.\n\n1 Mr. Pizza's sauce taste's lively! La Nova's = flat.\n2 Mr. Pizza I believe uses a better quality cheese.\n3 Mr. Pizza's dough, this is important because I believe it separates\na so so pizza into a way better tasting pizza. The dough from Mr. Pizza has a crunch to it! No, it's NOT burnt, it's just awesome! Not only that, but the dough also seems like there's a touch of sweetness to it. It's very subtle, but very good. Whoever came up with this recipe, knew what they were doing!\n\nThis is what makes Mr. Pizza like one of the best tasting pizzas\nEVER!\n\nThere are a lot of pizzerias out there, but Mr. Pizza's pizza is like Gourmet in comparison! La Nova's is a beautiful place, but their pizza is like eh! 4.0-4.5 on a scale of 1-10, It's nothing great.\n\nMr. Pizza's pizza on a scale of 1-10, I would give them a solid 8. So why even mention La Nova? Well if it weren't for that slop they sold me that they call pizza I would have never longed for such a greater tasting pizza such as Mr. Pizza's pizza!\n\nMr. Pizza's Pizza Is Simply Better! Like \"WAY BETTER!\"\n\nZap",

          "text": "OK, tonight was kinda like the last straw I moved in the area. This is probably my third time ordering from the place now. I know that you stay open kinda late so you know people get tired and things like that which is understandable but when I place a order And I tell them specifically how I want it made it should come to me exactly how I want my food, seeing as how expensive the food is nowadays‚Ä¶.\nnow today I order a calzone. I tell them I want everything crust Italian sausage well done onions, pepperonis (chard) , tomatoes.   When it came, the presentation was fine yes, it was a little darker on the top, but I asked for it well done and I don‚Äôt mind it being a little dark now when I spoke to the guy on the phone, I asked where they gonna cook the onions with my Italian sausage the guy told me yeah I also asked for tomatoes thinking that he will put the tomatoes on the grill with the meat as well seeing as though it‚Äôs a calzone, he put saut√©ed onions and just straight, diced tomatoes on my calzone you would think a cook would have enough sense to know to not put the saut√©ed onions and raw tomatoes. Straight in the calzone because when you bake it, it‚Äôs going to present some type of moisture. The proper way would be to cook my meat, cook fresh onion with the meat, chopped them up add the tomatoes last my pepperoni should have been charred on the grill, which never happened!!!!!!. They sent me those straight out of the pack as well, which they‚Äôre gonna have to cook inside this dough and cheese and present moisture as well from the grease !!!!!!!! Thats specifically why I asked him to char  my pepperonis it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs one thing to order something and not like it but come on for me to basically explain to you exactly how I want my food and it come a complete different way. It‚Äôs just insane. Oh, and might I add there was barely any ricotta cheese in my calzone now I‚Äôm sitting here at 2:20 AM $30 less picking through a soggy mess  pissed and I honestly know how business is it‚Äôs probably not even the cooks fault it‚Äôs probably the person who answered the phone but come on guys I know the small things can be annoying at times, but those are the things that keep good customers coming",

Employees went above and beyond for years---writing special messages in the boxes to encourage my students, and it always left them smiling! As the years went by...it's been the only place I've ordered from. They are reasonable and realistic with their pricing. Their pizza is always consistent and delicious.  Their gluten free pizza is great as well.",

            "text": "I dont know what's going on with this place. One day you can get great food but most days you get bad garbage. The price Never changes tho im paying full price for hot trash. I ordered some wings at noon on a Friday I get em and open the box and these things must of been refried about 8 times. They looked like someone dropped em behind the oven and they found em and slapped my name on em. The blue cheese tasted like mayo im pretty sure this was someone's old order they never picked up and best of all I had to wait 15 minutes after the 30 minutes they said it would take for em.  I work hard for my money and I feel like these dudes just got me. Prolly gunna be the last time I go there because this isn't the first time this has happened. Unfortunately I was too far up the road to take em back and my leg was busted anyway so I couldn't drive and my ride left. I was thinking about them wings all morning lol.  I won't be taking chances anymore on this place. You shouldn't either. Theres only like 2 people there that genuinely seem like they are happy you brought your business to them everyone else is chuckin the food across the shop looking like they hate you for wanting food. For what yall charge I can do better.  Its a shame cause yall was the best. I hope yall get it together.",

After 1&1/2 hours they still hadn‚Äôt delivered them even after two phone calls to find out why. I finally canceled the order. Then they were rude when I canceled! Won‚Äôt give them another chance.",
