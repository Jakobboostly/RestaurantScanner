There is no better pizza in this area. The sauce on the pizza is literally addicting and the dough is mouth watering. Their wings are massive and delicious as well as their cheesesteaks and other subs. This is my go to pizza spot, especially during the hockey season. Doesn‚Äôt hurt that the owners are absolutely fantastic people too. Highly recommend to check out, especially if you are a NJ Devils fan.",

From the moment you walk through the door, you‚Äôre hit with that irresistible aroma of fresh dough, bubbling cheese, and perfectly balanced tomato sauce, the kind of smell that instantly takes you back to childhood pizza nights.\n\nThe crust here is exactly what a Jersey pie should be: crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with just the right \"bubbles\" by the crust's edge. The sauce is bright, flavorful, and seasoned just right: not too sweet, not too tangy, and of course, fresh basil.  The cheese? Melted to perfection with those little golden brown spots that pizza lovers dream about.\n\nOur go to is \"The Bees Knees\" pie, which has pepperoni, hot honey, and ricotta.  We also get a plain pie (cheese) each time we order, not just for the kids, also for snack slices over the next couple of days\n\nThe place is family owned and operated by some of the best people I know.  You can taste the love and generations of knowledge & skill that goes into the food.\n\nGreat people, amazing food, and NJ Devils fans to boot. This place is a local staple and Garden State gem.  Thanks Amicis!!!!",

          "text": "‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\nDuring our trip to New Jersey, my mom and I decided to try Amici‚Äôs, and I can honestly say it was one of the best decisions we made. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with such warmth and friendliness from the owner it immediately felt like a place where everyone is welcome, not just a pizza shop. We mentioned how we were from Scranton, PA.  That kind of energy makes the food taste even better, but trust me when I say the pizza speaks for itself.\nNow, I have to explain something: I‚Äôve never really been a ‚Äúpizza person.‚Äù In fact, I didn‚Äôt even start eating pizza until about 8 years ago, and even then, I‚Äôve only found a couple of places where I actually enjoy it. So when I tell you that Amici‚Äôs is on a whole other level, I mean it. The crust was perfectly baked, the sauce had the right balance of flavor, and the cheese just melted in your mouth. Every bite felt like it was made with love. My mom is a big pizza lover, and even she said it was the BEST pizza she‚Äôs ever had in her life and for her to say that means everything.\nWhat makes Amici‚Äôs stand out isn‚Äôt just the food, though. It‚Äôs the whole experience. The owner didn‚Äôt treat us like customers; he treated us like family. That genuine, welcoming spirit is rare to find these days, and it made us feel right at home.\nI never thought I would find a place where I could say, ‚ÄúI LOVE this pizza,‚Äù but Amici‚Äôs has truly changed that for me. This is the SPOT. Every time I come back to Jersey, it‚Äôs going to be my first stop without question. If you‚Äôre in the area and want pizza that will leave you talking about it long after your last bite, do yourself a favor and stop here. You won‚Äôt regret it.\nHighly, highly recommend! My mouth is watering just thinking of it right now ü•≤",

So if you are planning to order pls ask if they will give the order on time. After all this the reason was they missed the order and there were lot of orders.

From the moment you walk through the door, you‚Äôre hit with that irresistible aroma of fresh dough, bubbling cheese, and perfectly balanced tomato sauce, the kind of smell that instantly takes you back to childhood pizza nights.\n\nThe crust here is exactly what a Jersey pie should be: crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with just the right \"bubbles\" by the crust's edge. The sauce is bright, flavorful, and seasoned just right: not too sweet, not too tangy, and of course, fresh basil.  The cheese? Melted to perfection with those little golden brown spots that pizza lovers dream about.\n\nOur go to is \"The Bees Knees\" pie, which has pepperoni, hot honey, and ricotta.  We also get a plain pie (cheese) each time we order, not just for the kids, also for snack slices over the next couple of days\n\nThe place is family owned and operated by some of the best people I know.  You can taste the love and generations of knowledge & skill that goes into the food.\n\nGreat people, amazing food, and NJ Devils fans to boot. This place is a local staple and Garden State gem.  Thanks Amicis!!!!",

I didn't end up staying too long as I had to go but I also saw how they treated other customers and how other customers felt very comfortable. Not many places are like this nowadays so definitely go check it out. It's a W place",

The crust was crispy yet soft and unbelievable - no flop! The pizza was savory and had the perfect dollops of ricotta. The cheese wasn't slopping off, everything stayed together nicely. It even had a unique crust that had \"everything but the bagel\" seasoning encrusted on top. I normally don't go for a white pizza but seeing this at first glance I just felt gravitated to try it and I'm glad I did! This is a great family operated pizzeria. The family is super kind and proud of their business which I took away in the few moments I interacted with them at the festival. I wish them all the best and hope to stop by for some more of their pizza if I'm ever in the area! I recommend you try them!",

It‚Äôs fantastic on this gigantic garlic slider that they make, with real garlic butter none of that fake stuff! And the vodka sauce? Out of this world!\n\nYou can get slices but getting a whole pie is the way to go! And if you want a more elevated experience, they have a dining room complete with artwork and lighting. And if you want a cute appetizer to start get the fried gnocchi!",

Large buffalo wings with Bleu cheese. Penne vodka with chicken)\n\nEasy drive to get here (right off route 36)\nPlenty of parking spots. They are a part of a small strip mall that includes a sushi spot, gym, dollar store, nail salon etc so parking is never an issue.\n\nWings were the crispy and just the right amount of sauce. Pizza was perfect, melty cheese with the thin crust that was in between soft and firm.\nPasta was huge.. it was packed full with chicken. Needed a little salt though.\n\nHands down the best pizza for the price around the area.\nThey also have a loyalty program. Just add your phone number and after you spend $100, you'll get 10% off your next order.",

            "text": "‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\nDuring our trip to New Jersey, my mom and I decided to try Amici‚Äôs, and I can honestly say it was one of the best decisions we made. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with such warmth and friendliness from the owner it immediately felt like a place where everyone is welcome, not just a pizza shop. We mentioned how we were from Scranton, PA.  That kind of energy makes the food taste even better, but trust me when I say the pizza speaks for itself.\nNow, I have to explain something: I‚Äôve never really been a ‚Äúpizza person.‚Äù In fact, I didn‚Äôt even start eating pizza until about 8 years ago, and even then, I‚Äôve only found a couple of places where I actually enjoy it. So when I tell you that Amici‚Äôs is on a whole other level, I mean it. The crust was perfectly baked, the sauce had the right balance of flavor, and the cheese just melted in your mouth. Every bite felt like it was made with love. My mom is a big pizza lover, and even she said it was the BEST pizza she‚Äôs ever had in her life and for her to say that means everything.\nWhat makes Amici‚Äôs stand out isn‚Äôt just the food, though. It‚Äôs the whole experience. The owner didn‚Äôt treat us like customers; he treated us like family. That genuine, welcoming spirit is rare to find these days, and it made us feel right at home.\nI never thought I would find a place where I could say, ‚ÄúI LOVE this pizza,‚Äù but Amici‚Äôs has truly changed that for me. This is the SPOT. Every time I come back to Jersey, it‚Äôs going to be my first stop without question. If you‚Äôre in the area and want pizza that will leave you talking about it long after your last bite, do yourself a favor and stop here. You won‚Äôt regret it.\nHighly, highly recommend! My mouth is watering just thinking of it right now ü•≤",

This is after checking on the status of the order every 20 mins with them and they saying it‚Äôs in the oven. Kept the whole family waiting . After 1 hour 15 mins got the pizzas. So if you are planning to order pls ask if they will give the order on time. After all this the reason was they missed the order and there were lot of orders. But the people who came after half an hour after us got their order and even left.",
