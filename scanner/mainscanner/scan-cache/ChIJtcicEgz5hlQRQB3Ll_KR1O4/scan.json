          "text": "Wow, BAD. What happened to Luz??  We called in an order of 3 flour chicken tacos, fish on flour, and churros. We‚Äôve eaten here so many times and enjoyed it over the last few years, but we won‚Äôt be back after tonight. We said ‚Äúflour tortillas‚Äù twice, confirming it at the end of the call. Got home after picking up the order to unwrap 3 chicken tacos on corn tortillas, and the driest tacos I‚Äôve ever had from Luz, tasted completely stale. We had to drive back to get another order which was finally on flour bread (again, stale in texture, chicken rubbery), and lacking flavour. When my partner asked for a hot sauce, the guy said ‚Äúhold on let me ring that up‚Äù. Sorry, what?! We just had to drive all the way back after your mistake, and now one of our meals will be cold, and you want us to pay for a hot sauce?? ‚ÄúYa because the cost of things has gone up so I have to punch it in.‚Äù A tiny side cup of hot sauce. Not only should that have been comped, but our meal should have been comped. Clearly the service has turned to crap there, the food not far behind. Not the Luz that it used to be and you‚Äôve lost 2 locals.",

I had the carnitas burrito and it was packed with love. There is a patio but you would have to order at the brewery to use it. There are two benches on the side of the food truck if you want to eat on a nice sunny day. Essentially you order the food and they have the wireless coaster pager so you will know once your order has finished. I definitely recommend trying it out of you are in the area. You can also order online or simply call and place an order ahead of time.",

          "text": "Wow, BAD. What happened to Luz??  We called in an order of 3 flour chicken tacos, fish on flour, and churros. We‚Äôve eaten here so many times and enjoyed it over the last few years, but we won‚Äôt be back after tonight. We said ‚Äúflour tortillas‚Äù twice, confirming it at the end of the call. Got home after picking up the order to unwrap 3 chicken tacos on corn tortillas, and the driest tacos I‚Äôve ever had from Luz, tasted completely stale. We had to drive back to get another order which was finally on flour bread (again, stale in texture, chicken rubbery), and lacking flavour. When my partner asked for a hot sauce, the guy said ‚Äúhold on let me ring that up‚Äù. Sorry, what?! We just had to drive all the way back after your mistake, and now one of our meals will be cold, and you want us to pay for a hot sauce?? ‚ÄúYa because the cost of things has gone up so I have to punch it in.‚Äù A tiny side cup of hot sauce. Not only should that have been comped, but our meal should have been comped. Clearly the service has turned to crap there, the food not far behind. Not the Luz that it used to be and you‚Äôve lost 2 locals.",

Those were some of the best tacos I have ever had and we live in Las Vegas and travel to California all the time. The hot sauce was creamy and spicy and not too hot. The birra taco had a great meat flavor that was juicy and spicy and the two corn tortillas are a must. The fish taco was outstanding with its crispy battered piece atop cabbage with some pickled onions, a cream sauce and the hot sauce. Next time we will ask for more hot sauce in the side as it was that good. Didn‚Äôt take photos of food, because we ate it super fast, but presentation was very appealing. We will be back here again when going to Whistler next year.\n\nCame back in March for skiing, still the BEST fried fish tacos ever. We love this place so much and wish we could visit more often.",

          "text": "I have formally left a 5* review for Luz Tacos. I have been visiting Luz for about 3 years, relatively frequently from Whistler. I was initially shown Luz by a friend when it was a good truck outside a frame brewery. I must have had tacos there more than 20 times, both at the food truck and when it changed location to geo cidre and have always found the tacos to be exquisite. I travelled Mexico for 2 months a few years ago and these usually are the best tacos outside of Mexico and one of my favourite places to eat on the sea to sky. Yesterday on the way to the city, we decided to take some friends on the way down and were bitterly disappointed. Something has definitely changed, despite the server telling us otherwise. First of all the tacos aren't even on the menu, nor is there any references to Luz Tacos. The server explained this as something to do with the landlord having issues with another of their owned properties and not being able to have 2 mexican places, whatever that means.\nThe presentation of the tacos was completely different, they usually come on a tray with 3 connected \"v's\" so you can easily pickup the tacos and they're wrapped in 2 tortillas as you can see in other reviews posted to Google.\nThe tacos I had yesterday were frankly terrible, they were missing heaps of ingredients and sauces. I always ask for mine to be extra spicy and they're made that way, yesterday I was given a little pot of sauce to put on myself. Usually the tacos are quite messy to eat because of the amount of sauce dripping from them. I had 2 pastor (my favourite) and 1 carnitas as usual and I can absolutely guarantee this was the same taco as usual. Either geo cidre is lying that Luz tacos is still there and it's their food, or something terrible has happened. RIP Luz Tacos",

It would be good to see the weekend nights with a bit more ambient lighting and louder music to give more of a cocktail bar feel.\nThe menu is a mix of taco options, burritos, nachos.\nWhile all the food options I‚Äôve tried taste great I feel the omission of guacamole to be an oversight, especially with the nachos.\nPrice is slightly high given the simple food options but happy that location exists in this part of town for occasional visits.",

We hope the meat lovers tacos that had pork carnitas, Chipotle chicken, and fish, as well as the spec'Taco'lar which had crispy cauliflower done up like a fish taco, fried beans, and a sauteed vegetable medley. All of it was so good and my only critique is that the fish taco could be crispier. Other than that, the flavors were spectacular and the service very friendly and efficient. It was a little hard to spot this place because the cider sign is much larger than the Luz Tacos sign.",

We‚Äôve eaten here so many times and enjoyed it over the last few years, but we won‚Äôt be back after tonight. We said ‚Äúflour tortillas‚Äù twice, confirming it at the end of the call. Got home after picking up the order to unwrap 3 chicken tacos on corn tortillas, and the driest tacos I‚Äôve ever had from Luz, tasted completely stale. We had to drive back to get another order which was finally on flour bread (again, stale in texture, chicken rubbery), and lacking flavour. When my partner asked for a hot sauce, the guy said ‚Äúhold on let me ring that up‚Äù. Sorry, what?! We just had to drive all the way back after your mistake, and now one of our meals will be cold, and you want us to pay for a hot sauce?? ‚ÄúYa because the cost of things has gone up so I have to punch it in.‚Äù A tiny side cup of hot sauce. Not only should that have been comped, but our meal should have been comped. Clearly the service has turned to crap there, the food not far behind. Not the Luz that it used to be and you‚Äôve lost 2 locals.",
