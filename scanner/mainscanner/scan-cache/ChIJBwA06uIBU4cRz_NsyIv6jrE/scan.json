The white walls and painting remind me of being in Greece. The seating is simple and casual.

Was not sure what to get so I got the combo plate to make sure I try a little of everything.\n\nüëéüëéThe only thing I didn't like was having to pay a forced 4% transaction fee for using a credit or debit card. I think it should be all encompassed into the price point vs having to pay more if you don't have cash. Almost just like a forced tip so to speak before you even try your food. Not that big of deal just my opinion I wanted to share. üòâ But Maravel was great and friendly. They do have a free drink on Mondays if that is your thing. üëç (that was also a surprise in not in a bad way) üòÇ üëç\n\nOnly other miss was that it was 83 degrees inside on a 62 degree day.
