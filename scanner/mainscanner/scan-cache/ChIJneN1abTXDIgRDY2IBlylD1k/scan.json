I had the Porketta sandwich with tender slices of pork loin marinated and piled high with baby spinach leaves and pepper salad. It was great. My wife had the Sicilian Sausage sandwich with a spicy red sauce. My son tried the Baldorata, which was a combo of both, and the Muffaletta sandwich made with real Pistachio Mortadella. It will be my place in Champaign.\nAnother plus is the 25 O'clock brewery right next door!! They serve an eclectic variety of beers, with homemade ginger ale for the kiddies. Benches and board games, free pool and darts, and you can order any food from Baldarotta's next door, and they will deliver it to for free. Great Combo spot for great food and great beer.\nLocated just east of route 45. On Griggs street, a block south of University Drive.",

Fries have been reformulated since the move from Lincoln square. They are aggressively seasoned and offered with your choice of a selection of house-made condiments, all of which are delicious. Try the red pepper ketchup even if (like me) you are not a ketchup person. The Tuesday special Agglassato is like an italian-ized roast beef sandwich. It's comfort on a french roll.\n\nCons:\nIf you eat an entire sandwich, you may experience an unscheduled nap. Worth it.\nThey're not open on Mondays.\n\nGet food here. They are awesome.",

Personally, I do not really care for Italian sausage, but this place makes it in-house, and it is phenomenal! All of their sides are homemade, their Gelato is homemade, their canolis are homemade, their homemade is homeade! You need to go here! This will be a place we regularly visit when we are in Champaign/Urbana. Side-note: There is a brewery (25 O'Clock Brewing) next door that Baldarotta's has a little snack menu at. If you check their hours. Grab a sandwich, grab a beer, and have a great meal.",

Literally everything was so delish!\n\nWe were greeted upon entry and although I briefly looked at the menu online, there‚Äôs so much other randomness that‚Äôs available!  Be sure to follow their socials for specials and limited menu items that aren‚Äôt on the paper menus at the counter.\n\nWe ordered the Baldarotta, Italian Beef, and Turkey Pesto-Hot.  Also got an order of fries and the Sicilian Potato Salad. Then ran away with 2 pistachio cannolis!\n\nThere are quite a few tables in the dining area. I really enjoyed that each table was different with a different set of chairs for each table.  There are restrooms available‚Ä¶which was great because I definitely got messy!\n\nThe namesake Baldarotta had a combination of the porketta and sausage and it made me smile from ear to ear! Such a comforting sandwich.  The Italian Beef came with a a whole wide container of au jus for optimal dipping and was so flavorful!  The Turkey pesto ordered hot (vs. cold) is a game changer! The pesto Mayo was DELISH!  Fries were well seasoned.  The potato salad had olives in it and I enjoyed that as well! The cannolis we took to go and enjoyed them later that evening! I loved how it wasn‚Äôt too sweet at all!\n\nParking was easy as there are spaces in the back. They are next to a brewery so could see pairing these tasty eats with a drink or two next door.\n\nWill definitely be back!",

          "text": "My son found this place.  What a gem! They serve Sicilian Deli sandwiches here that are outstanding. I had the Porketta sandwich with tender slices of pork loin marinated and piled high with baby spinach leaves and pepper salad. It was great. My wife had the Sicilian Sausage sandwich with a spicy red sauce. My son tried the Baldorata, which was a combo of both, and the Muffaletta sandwich made with real Pistachio Mortadella. It will be my place in Champaign.\nAnother plus is the 25 O'clock brewery right next door!! They serve an eclectic variety of beers, with homemade ginger ale for the kiddies. Benches and board games, free pool and darts, and you can order any food from Baldarotta's next door, and they will deliver it to for free. Great Combo spot for great food and great beer.\nLocated just east of route 45. On Griggs street, a block south of University Drive.",

          "text": "After today's experience at Baldarotta's Porketta & Sicilian Sausage we will never be going back. The level of unprofessionalism and discrimination exhibited by one of their owners was astonishing.\n\nTo give a brief synopsis we were excited to try out their new location for lunch. We were immediately met with rudeness for no apparent reason by the woman at the counter, I later learned she was actually one of the owners. I honestly just brushed it off and didn't think too much into it at first. But that changed the moment we said we would be eating there and she stepped out from the counter and said \"I'm going to stick you guys in here.\" as she turned on the light to the extra dining room. For context there's maybe 15 tables in their main dining room and two or three of them had customers. Additionally, this was around 11:30 am and there were no customers behind us in line. The extra dining room was dirty and had food on the floor and the tables needed cleaned. The couple that had been in front of us got great customer service and the woman was very pleasant with them. It became very apparent that we were being treated differently due to the dog, who is a trained service dog being with us. We decided to ask for our money back and leave even though we love their food and have been looking forward to it. When we walked back into the main room and asked if we could cancel our order and be refunded the response we received was absolutely in a harsh tone. She gave me my cash back and I said thank you. She responded by ignoring me and acting as if I was invisible.\n\nWe walked around the building to the parking lot and I told my husband that I couldn't leave without having a conversation with her because the entire interaction just did not sit well with me. I walked back in and patiently waited for a couple at the counter to finish ordering. It should be noted the light to the other dining area we were told to go sit in was off again. Again when I approached I received a cold response after witnessing her being very pleasant with the couple in front of me. I asked if I could speak with a manager or someone in charge. That is when she informed me that it was her and she was a part owner.  I asked her why she has been so rude towards us and that we felt discriminated against because of our service dog. She told me she didn't see anything stating he was a service dog. I explained ADA law does not require a service animal to be vested and that she never asked if he was or even mentioned dogs were not allowed, had she asked or said something we would have informed her he was. I would also like to note that the majority of our interaction with her the dog was sitting or in a down stay not causing any issues. She admitted that she did treat us differently because of the dog and said she could have handled the situation better but never actually took accountability or apologized for the entire situation.\n\nI'm sorry for the long read but I truly couldn't stay quiet about this. I hope she learned something from this interaction today and as much as I'm saddened and disappointed in the entire situation I'm honestly glad it happened to us and not someone who is not able to speak up for themselves. I truly hope they decide to do some self reflecting and learn how to be more accommodating for individuals with disabilities in the future.",

Every time I order online and come to pick up at the time shown on the order receipt, it always takes me at lease another 10-15 minites to wait in the shop. If I have to wait that long all the time, what‚Äôs the point of having me ordering online and showing me a pick-up time 15 minutes different from whatever the real pick up time it really is???
