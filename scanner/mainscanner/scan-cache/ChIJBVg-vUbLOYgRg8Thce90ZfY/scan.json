          "text": "We both ordered off the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù menu last night and although the food was good it didn‚Äôt seem to hit the spot for either of us. We frequent this restaurant and there are so many great menu items that we‚Äôve come to love. Angry Pig pizza, meatball appetizer, Carne DiPapa appetizer, & Steak Salad are a few of my favorites. I‚Äôve also learned to combine the Steak Sandwich and Truffle Mushroom Melt for a delicious sandwich. The staff is always friendly and we‚Äôve never had issues with cleanliness. They rotate the taps from local breweries which is nice.  If you‚Äôre just passing through or live in the area, my family and I highly recommend giving Burrata Woodfired a try. We were pleasantly surprised when we went last night and they were having Tuesday trivia, which apparently they do every week. That was a lot of fun and we plan to go back for trivia again soon.",

            "text": "We both ordered off the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù menu last night and although the food was good it didn‚Äôt seem to hit the spot for either of us. We frequent this restaurant and there are so many great menu items that we‚Äôve come to love. Angry Pig pizza, meatball appetizer, Carne DiPapa appetizer, & Steak Salad are a few of my favorites. I‚Äôve also learned to combine the Steak Sandwich and Truffle Mushroom Melt for a delicious sandwich. The staff is always friendly and we‚Äôve never had issues with cleanliness. They rotate the taps from local breweries which is nice.  If you‚Äôre just passing through or live in the area, my family and I highly recommend giving Burrata Woodfired a try. We were pleasantly surprised when we went last night and they were having Tuesday trivia, which apparently they do every week. That was a lot of fun and we plan to go back for trivia again soon.",

The kids enjoyed the Duo (two meatballs, garlic bread, and a salad) and cheese pizza.\n\nThe italiano sub is on another level.\n\nBloody Mary, yes yes yes!\n\nBig Pappa pizza is superb.\n\nI‚Äôd bet everything on the menu is fantastic. Give this place a go!",
