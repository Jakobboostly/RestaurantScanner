It finally piqued my interest because there's a billboard for it leaving Spring Grove, headed toward 30, on 116.\n\nGood pizza as far as strip mall pizzas go.  Not as much grease as other places.  Still had to soak it up with napkins.\n\nInside was decent.  I liked the table clothes, although they were beat up.  The place could use an upgrade.  It was pretty clean thoggh.  But I'm sure it pulls in some good business.  While I was there, they had a few people coming in for takeout.\n\nI liked the simple, go up to the counter and order.  No where did I see a sign asking for tip.  I paid with a card and had no annoying screen asking me to pay a tip. If you have tip fatigue, this place is great!",

My team and I visited and most of us ordered a Boli. We were told a small would feed one person. So I ordered a large.\nHoly Stromboli, this thing was huge. I only got through half but I brought it home so I can enjoy it for the next two days. It was so good I felt like it was sent from heaven above. This was EASILY the best food I have ever eaten in Pennsylvania. I can't recommend Shakey Jakes enough. Can't wait to go there again in 3 days when I finally finish my large Boli.",

My team and I visited and most of us ordered a Boli. We were told a small would feed one person. So I ordered a large.\nHoly Stromboli, this thing was huge. I only got through half but I brought it home so I can enjoy it for the next two days. It was so good I felt like it was sent from heaven above. This was EASILY the best food I have ever eaten in Pennsylvania. I can't recommend Shakey Jakes enough. Can't wait to go there again in 3 days when I finally finish my large Boli.",
