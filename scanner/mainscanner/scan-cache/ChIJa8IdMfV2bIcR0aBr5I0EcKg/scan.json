I love treating myself to breakfast every Sunday, and I usually bring my laptop to get some writing done while enjoying my burrito.  The T's burrito is my personal favorite, especially with sausage. But what truly sets Renegade Burrito apart is the exceptional staff at the Thornton location. They are always friendly and just glad to see you. They remember my order better than I do.  And since I sit and eat in the dining room, I can tell that they treat everyone just as well.

But what truly sets Renegade Burrito apart is the exceptional staff at the Thornton location. They are always friendly and just glad to see you. They remember my order better than I do.  And since I sit and eat in the dining room, I can tell that they treat everyone just as well.  If you are looking for great food and to be served by people who truly appreciate you, this is the place to go every time.\n\nHighly recommend!",
