Upon arrival we were happy to find the mill room had a separate entrance so we didn‚Äôt have to walk thru the main entrance of the restaurant. The space was absolutely beautiful and there was lots of room for our guests to enjoy. We had food catered by the dew drop and it was delicious. We will absolutely be using the dew drop for all of our future events. I cannot recommend this place enough! Amazing job to our bartender and again to Brigette for such an incredible service!",

          "text": "While my husband and I eat at The Kozy and The Dew Drop frequently, I actually would like to specifically call out The Mill Room. We held my daughter‚Äòs reception here on July 5 and invited close to 80 people. It was hot as Hades outside but inside it was nice and cool as was all the help! Bridget, who helped coordinate the event with us, couldn‚Äôt have been better. Through the entire process, she responded when I reached out and was a great at recommending vendors or Assistance when we needed it. While the space was a little tight for nearly 80 people at 10 tables the buffet worked out really well. We had an open bar, an insured that all of the top brand liquors we wanted and beers were available. Every guest raved about the food. They said the brisket and mac & cheese was the best they had had anywhere. They were even able to adjust one of the entr√©es to our liking due to food intolerance issues.One of our friends who is really critical of food in general said it had to be one of the best meals he‚Äôs ever eaten at a wedding reception ever. The decorating vendor that Bridget recommended was also great to work with. They worked together so that when we walked into the space, it was just beautiful! But I have to say the space is gorgeous all on its own. I would highly recommend hosting your next event here!",

Staff was friendly and prompt even though the place had a decent crowd for a mid after noon. We'll most likely stop off here again when out riding.\n(2025) We were camping in the area and wanted to head out for a meal to escape the heat a bit. Stopped for an early-ish dinner around 5. There was a minimal crowd and we were able to find a table right away. Staff was amazingly friendly (again) and very apologetic when they were out of the beer my hubby wanted. We ordered drinks, and meals which were prepared well and brought out promptly. We've been here a handful of times now, and it has become our go-to spot to stop if we're in the area because we know we can count on decent food, reasonable prices, and great service.",
