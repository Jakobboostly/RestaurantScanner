I waited for over half an hour for my food and it was never brought out to me. I had to go up and ask where my food was, and it turns out it had been sitting in the \"pick up order\" warmer for who-knows-how-long. Not only did they fail to deliver my food properly, but they just ignored me the entire time. I know they had delivered other people's to-go orders because I saw them do it while I was there. I had been sitting in plain sight with an order number, obviously waiting for my order, and in that entire time they just ignored me and didn't bother to provide any kind of customer service.\n\nAs for why I waited half an hour without saying anything, it was a Saturday night and there were a few large parties seated in the dining area, so I assumed that they were busy and my food was in line behind the large parties. I didn't realize there was an issue until I saw a new person walk in and get their food within a few minutes. I had run out to the car to grab something after placing my order, so it's possible that they tried to first deliver my food in those few seconds I stepped outside, but that makes it even worse because that means the employees just ignored me for over 30 minutes when I'm clearly waiting for an order.",

The \"slabs\" they serve are very well sized and delicious.\n\nThe salad was good too.\n\nThey also bring the food to you, which I think is very nice.

They no longer make my 2 favorite pizza even though they have all the ingredients for other pizzas for it.  I asked if they could just make it even though it wasn't on the menu, but they said they are not allowed to.  I will not be craving slab as much as I once did.  However, they did add guarana to the fountain, so thats a plus.",
