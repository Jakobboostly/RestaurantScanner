I would give them a Michelin starü§© if I had the power and If I ever come to Fla again they will be our first stop.

We had the pulled pork sandwiches and used their homemade BBQ sauce and rub, which is on each table. Great smoky flavor in the meats and so tender. We were able to taste test the smoked chicken salad, brisket, and smoked turkey, all were amazing. We tried the homemade Key Lime Pie tart, and again it was spot on in flavor. Just the right amount of key lime tart flavor and a nice sweet and creamy taste. We met the owners and they are so nice. We will definitely return again and we see that they serve breakfast!!!",

I recommend the Brisket it was juicy and tender but not greasy, the ribs are seasoned to perfection, & sausage is not to be passed up! For desert we loved the apple cobbler best but the banana pudding with nillas was also top teir! And of course the BBQ sauce has clearly won awards for good reason! Coming from New Orleans We know flavor & are very picky and left completely satisfied with no complaints & will be back when we come by on our beach trips regularly now!",

The brisket was done just right.  I saw other posts stating it was too dry but that definitely was not the case today. The side of potato salad was really good too.  My wife got the chicken baked potato with a side of fried okra. Both were good as well. There were only two barbecue sauce options, regular and sweet. The regular was pretty tangy but good. The sweet sauce was good, personally I like it a little bit sweeter than it was. Our food came out rather quickly.\n\nGreat food, clean restaurant and bathrooms. If I lived closer, I‚Äôd make it a regular stop.",

Ten dollars for sandwich and eleven dollars for 1/2 chicken .  They don‚Äôt come with sides and cost 4-5 dollars for each side , and drinks 4 dollars per drink .  Hige profit margin on these . That is what drives yor total costs up . No combination platters with multiple meats - weird to me .",

My family and I are originally North Carolina residents and I spoke very highly of their food and it being like home. It was the worst experience the FOH was extremely rood and unhelpful they had every order in front of ours wrong. Honestly when I finally got our order I left knowing my family and I were just going to get whatever we were given and I was exactly right. None of our food was correct so we just opened boxes and shared our mystery dinner. They have fallen a long way since their son and served closely together in a local church and military service. He worked extremely hard and I sampled most of their products while they were being perfected. I've known this family and their sons efforts to build a great brand for many years and hope this was only a one time bad night they were having.",

We had the pulled pork sandwiches and used their homemade BBQ sauce and rub, which is on each table. Great smoky flavor in the meats and so tender. We were able to taste test the smoked chicken salad, brisket, and smoked turkey, all were amazing. We tried the homemade Key Lime Pie tart, and again it was spot on in flavor. Just the right amount of key lime tart flavor and a nice sweet and creamy taste. We met the owners and they are so nice. We will definitely return again and we see that they serve breakfast!!!",

The brisket was done just right.  I saw other posts stating it was too dry but that definitely was not the case today. The side of potato salad was really good too.  My wife got the chicken baked potato with a side of fried okra. Both were good as well. There were only two barbecue sauce options, regular and sweet. The regular was pretty tangy but good. The sweet sauce was good, personally I like it a little bit sweeter than it was. Our food came out rather quickly.\n\nGreat food, clean restaurant and bathrooms. If I lived closer, I‚Äôd make it a regular stop.",

Highly recommend the sweet potatoes fries ‚Äî they come with a tasty brown sugar dipping sauce ** chef‚Äôs kiss ** They toast their hot dog buns and I‚Äôm now afraid my daughter will request that at home because she loved it so much.  The chips & queso & salsa was great: a simple white queso and seasoned homemade chips.  I also judge places by their sweet tea and they passed the test! Our server was sweet and made sure to get our food in right away.  No mistakes with our order and made sure to check back in with us.  We‚Äôll be back :)",

Buh's has now become my go to BBQ in the Navarre area. (...and there are TWO locations!).\n\nI got the Rib Platter (6 ribs) instead of the Rib plate (3 ribs) in case the ribs were short ones. Well, they were definitely NOT short. I had to (reluctantly) share some with my dining mates. I love sweet potato fries and have never found the need to dip them in anything. Buh's fries certainly don't NEED dipping sauce. But the sweet dipping sauce is so good that I NEEDED the fries to scrape out every drop from the container.\n\nUpdate: 3/12/2025  I went back again today for lunch. This time I ordered the 3 rib plate, knowing I couldn't finish 6. Well imagine my surprise after I finished my first rib, there were still 3 on the plate!\n\nI was still only able to finish two of the four. Where else can you go and eat 2/3rd's of what you ordered and still have 2/3rd's left on the plate?\n\nTry Buh's. You will never be disappointed.",

We ordered the daily special:  sandwich and two sides. I got the Mac n cheese and baked beans. They tasted the same because there was sooooo much pepper, I couldn't even eat them. Only ate my sandwich (which was good!) Then my friend went to take a bite of his sandwich and there was the twist tie from the sandwich bag embedded on the bottom bun. I went snacking on the fried pickles we ordered, and there was a dark brown/black piece of hair. I was immediately done after that. The waitress asked if everything was OK, I said no, we would just like the check. She walked over to the register and said she could take us there. I told her I wasn't mad at her, but just wanted to go. I let her know what happened, and she made a questionable face and said \"well the managers will be here tomorrow, so I'll let them know.\" She didn't go look at all. Made me feel like I was lying about it. It was very rude and hurtful. Especially because I was trying to be calm and subtle about everything. Paid over $50 for 2 people (3 in my party) to eat 2 sandwiches. Absolutely horrible experience",

My family and I are originally North Carolina residents and I spoke very highly of their food and it being like home. It was the worst experience the FOH was extremely rood and unhelpful they had every order in front of ours wrong. Honestly when I finally got our order I left knowing my family and I were just going to get whatever we were given and I was exactly right. None of our food was correct so we just opened boxes and shared our mystery dinner. They have fallen a long way since their son and served closely together in a local church and military service. He worked extremely hard and I sampled most of their products while they were being perfected. I've known this family and their sons efforts to build a great brand for many years and hope this was only a one time bad night they were having.",
