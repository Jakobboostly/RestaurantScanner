It came nicely wrapped in a folded paper plate so you could open it up and hold the sandwich better when eating it.\n\nMy husband got a lamb wrap. He loves it!! It looks great too, and the sandwich is grilled on the outside.\n\nWe also ordered a portion of chicken plate to-go for the next day.\n\nThe owners are generous; we were still tucking into our food when the lady owner came to our table with a plate of freshly-cooked falafel! *drools*\n\nAnd later, the gentleman owner poured us little cups of hot tea. My lucky day, praise to God!\n\nIf you're ever at Fork Forty, and you cannot decide what to have, either of the above will not disappoint you.\n\nMy only regret was not packing away some baklavas. But hey, I will be back! üòä",

It came nicely wrapped in a folded paper plate so you could open it up and hold the sandwich better when eating it.\n\nMy husband got a lamb wrap. He loves it!! It looks great too, and the sandwich is grilled on the outside.\n\nWe also ordered a portion of chicken plate to-go for the next day.\n\nThe owners are generous; we were still tucking into our food when the lady owner came to our table with a plate of freshly-cooked falafel! *drools*\n\nAnd later, the gentleman owner poured us little cups of hot tea. My lucky day, praise to God!\n\nIf you're ever at Fork Forty, and you cannot decide what to have, either of the above will not disappoint you.\n\nMy only regret was not packing away some baklavas. But hey, I will be back! üòä",

It surpassed my expectations, and I was thrilled with the authentic food and the original taste of everything. The cleanliness, the taste, the service, the atmosphere, the coziness of the place, all were 10/10. I recommend give them a try. They have just started two months ago. This is an amazing start up.",
