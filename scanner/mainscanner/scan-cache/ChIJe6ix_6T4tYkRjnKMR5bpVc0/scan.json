The lady who took my order was nice and I ordered for delivery. I ordered a large cheese pizza, a ham and cheese sub, fried mushrooms, and French fries. The pizza was awful. It was not cooked all the way. The crust was still a blondish color and doughy in the middle. I had to put it in the oven. The pizza sauce is super sweet/sugary and doesn‚Äôt taste fresh. The cheese was not evenly distributed. Pizza is supposed to have a crispy outside and chewy inside. The fried mushrooms were not cooked all the way. The outside was brown but the inside had wet batter and it was watery. The mushrooms were still cool inside. The ham and cheese sub was a lot of lettuce with a few pieces of meat and the rest of the toppings. It is so frustrating to pay hard earned money for a meal that is awful. I will order from Kings or Tastebuds from now on. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",

The lady who took my order was nice and I ordered for delivery. I ordered a large cheese pizza, a ham and cheese sub, fried mushrooms, and French fries. The pizza was awful. It was not cooked all the way. The crust was still a blondish color and doughy in the middle. I had to put it in the oven. The pizza sauce is super sweet/sugary and doesn‚Äôt taste fresh. The cheese was not evenly distributed. Pizza is supposed to have a crispy outside and chewy inside. The fried mushrooms were not cooked all the way. The outside was brown but the inside had wet batter and it was watery. The mushrooms were still cool inside. The ham and cheese sub was a lot of lettuce with a few pieces of meat and the rest of the toppings. It is so frustrating to pay hard earned money for a meal that is awful. I will order from Kings or Tastebuds from now on. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",

We placed an online order for $37 and immediately upon placing the order the money was taken out of his account. He then received a notification to his phone that said \"This restaurant is now closed.\" But it wasn't. When we tried to call the store and fix the situation, the woman who answered the phone was very nasty and dismissive to my partner (who was being nothing but kind until she became rude), and basically insinuated that we were trying to get free food. It was incredibly unprofessional and I'm honestly in disbelief at how she handled the situation. I will never give another dollar to this place after that. We will be disputing the charge with our bank and taking our money elsewhere from now on.",

While the ingredients and bread were of exceptional quality, that's unfortunately all the subs consisted of‚Äîa large sandwich bun overflowing with lettuce but containing only four thin slices of ham and a single slice of cheese. The meat-to-bread ratio was severely unbalanced.\nWe also ordered a personal pan pizza for our little one, which was a complete disappointment. It arrived 40 minutes after ordering and 25 minutes after we had received our subs. The pizza appeared hastily prepared, with just melted, and no browning of the cheese and barely any sauce, forcing us to request a side of sauce for dipping.\nUnfortunately, businesses only get one chance to make a good first impression. This visit was both our first and last time at Anthony's.",

When I called to complain, I was told that's how it's supposed to be made and that they can make me a new one and send it out but they need the first one back. When I said I don't want either they told me too bad that's their policy. If that's how it's supposed to be made what makes them think I want another. Refused to give me my money back. I guess I paid $25 for something just to throw it in the trash",

The lady who took my order was nice and I ordered for delivery. I ordered a large cheese pizza, a ham and cheese sub, fried mushrooms, and French fries. The pizza was awful. It was not cooked all the way. The crust was still a blondish color and doughy in the middle. I had to put it in the oven. The pizza sauce is super sweet/sugary and doesn‚Äôt taste fresh. The cheese was not evenly distributed. Pizza is supposed to have a crispy outside and chewy inside. The fried mushrooms were not cooked all the way. The outside was brown but the inside had wet batter and it was watery. The mushrooms were still cool inside. The ham and cheese sub was a lot of lettuce with a few pieces of meat and the rest of the toppings. It is so frustrating to pay hard earned money for a meal that is awful. I will order from Kings or Tastebuds from now on. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",
