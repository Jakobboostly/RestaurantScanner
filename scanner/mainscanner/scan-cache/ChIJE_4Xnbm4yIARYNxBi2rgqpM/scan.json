She finally turned around after getting off her phone and I asked if there was table service and apparently it's a order at the counter deal.\nNo handheld menus, so it's a matter of searching up at the list posted above fast food style.\nFood was probably good, but we left to dine elsewhere.\n\n‚óèMy friend and I were in the area and thought we would give it a try. We saw a table with people dining so we went in. One of the cooks made eye contact with me, smiled, but no words. Just very basic table service would have been nice, but that's ok.\nThanks for the re-invite offer Carey. I'm sure the food is good, but maybe some other time. Best regards Jeff ‚óè",

          "text": "This is a real gem. Has a very high ratio of quality to price. Tastes like very expensive sushi but the price is good.\n\nWe talked to the owner. You can see an interview with him online (On Demand Sushi Interview with owner and entrepreneur Carey Parriott). He is very careful to make the rice properly, import it from Asia, cook it with the right amount of water for that particular batch of rice, etc. The rice is truly amazing in this sushi. I could eat tons of that sushi rice.\n\nHe also does some things differently from many of the cheap sushi joints in Vegas -- trying to make sushi better and give a better product. They have very fresh fish despite being an affordable sushi place.\n\nIf you get 5 or 8 items, (platter) you get 15% discount on all the rolls/sashimi/etc.\n\nThey have gluten-free non-GMO San-J tamari available at this location. I'm allergic to lots of soy tamari, but this non-GMO one is fine for me.\n\nI believe the wasabi is also gluten-free from looking at the ingredients label (horseradish, corn, maltodextrin, and coloring, so not real wasabi). I think they have fresh actual wasabi available if you ask for it (might be an extra charge).\n\nSome of our favorite rolls are salmon skin maki and Spicy crab. Everything we've had has been good. you can get rolls for under $5 so it's not hard to justify stopping by frequently.",

          "text": "I was extremely dissatisfied with their combo platter. I read people‚Äôs reviews that their portion sizes are good and you get a lot for your money‚Ä¶well I beg to differ. I ordered their 10 rolls combo party platter. Yeah sounds like a lot except it‚Äôs not when you‚Äôre just ordering sashimi. They really only had 3 varieties of fish (not including the octopus and eel) and it‚Äôs only 4 pieces. Depending on the fish you‚Äôre looking at $13-$14 for 4 pieces. I was hoping they‚Äôd be pretty big pieces for that price, but they are definitely not. It only looks like a lot if you order rolls because of the rice, but honestly with the amount that I paid for that party platter was definitely not worth it. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt do all sashimi, even though that‚Äôs what my in-laws wanted since they were serving it for their church members at our house. The tray would have looked so empty. I even ordered an extra roll and told them to put it with the rest so that it looks more full‚Ä¶.they did not do that and packed it separately. The large build your own party platter started at $125 plus extra up charge for certain rolls and sashimi fish. With tip, all in all it was roughly $150. I‚Äôll post a picture of the food and you guys can decide if it was worth it. I was trying to feed roughly around 12 elderly Koreans with this fish. Thank goodness I made other food or else this would not have been enough. I‚Äôm sorry, but I will not be ordering from this place again. The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one was because despite the amount, the ones who did get to eat it said it was good.\nAlso at the time (on Tuesday 2/21) their online ordering process was having issues and would not complete my order so I ended up having to call the place twice.",

Went to the counter and no acknowledgement from the counter lady. She finally turned around after getting off her phone and I asked if there was table service and apparently it's a order at the counter deal.\nNo handheld menus, so it's a matter of searching up at the list posted above fast food style.\nFood was probably good, but we left to dine elsewhere.\n\n‚óèMy friend and I were in the area and thought we would give it a try. We saw a table with people dining so we went in. One of the cooks made eye contact with me, smiled, but no words. Just very basic table service would have been nice, but that's ok.\nThanks for the re-invite offer Carey. I'm sure the food is good, but maybe some other time. Best regards Jeff ‚óè",
