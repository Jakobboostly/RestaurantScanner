They have specials on Buddha bowls I think Tuesday and Thursdays? The place is very clean and the staff are really nice. I wish they had a couple of more options for salad dressings like a cumin based taco flavored one and maybe a French one. It's also a comfortable eat in cafe and offers a clean restroom. It's not for the faint of wallet, but the quality to me, is worth my heath and wellness any day. Plus, I feel really good after I eat here too. Check it out.",

I don‚Äôt always have time to drive there during my work day and parking isn‚Äôt easy, so I prefer to order food for delivery, but won‚Äôt be doing so until I can be sure I‚Äôm getting the meal that I want and have paid quite a bit of money for.

I don't understand why they call themselves the best place for juices and things like that if they can't provide good service or have anything clean, a Total disgust, I will never return to that place in my life. I saw how they brought out new juices and gave me one that was already expiring. What a low place. They should close it  I don't know why they also have people who don't speak English. I had to deal with a black girl for like an entire hour so she could talk to me properly.",

Who, by the way, was bubbly yet easy-going, quick to offer guidance for a first time customer, and also worked quite expeditiously.  I will visit again,  indefinitely.  The options are limited when seeking juice bar/ smoothie spots around town, which is a complete bummer.  In my humble opinion, Vibe is an undoubtedly rare gem amidst a fast food and convenience store hell scape, in terms of finding a healthy alternative.  Lawd knows it is hard enough not to opt for quick and easily aquired junk when out and about,  especially when one typically has zero options for a wiser choice. Incredibly thankful this place is there and beyond delighted I'm able to give them my business.  Give Vibe a shot next time you are in need of tasty yet clean eats that leave you feeling energized and  rejuvenated. You will be glad you did!",

To then proceed and say to me after grabbing our smoothies despite the confusion. ‚ÄúNext time try getting up to get your smoothies and hear better‚Äù while rolling her eyes.\nSomehow these incidents of poor customer service that we experienced did not make it into the owners response to my review.\nI appreciate that my money was refunded for one of the two smoothies that were purchased after asking the manager for our money back.\nAlthough, had some accountability been taken for the blatant rudeness on the employees part from the employee, managers or owner, I would not have felt the need to share my negative experience on this public forum.\nSince this review, Alex, another manager at this establishment called me directly after leaving my information for the Owner to reach out.\nAlex listened to my neg. experience and told me he‚Äôd have a staff meeting.\nHopefully, this step by management will assist in fostering more adequate customer service skills for staff and a better overall customer experience for ALL customers.",

Their smoothies were just ok but I only went back because the options in the area are limited. Their smoothies are overpriced for nothing. The last time I ordered for pick up through grubhub there was a deal so I thought I get my daughter and I a smoothie after her school. I ordered the A√ßa√≠ and the Dragonfruit one and both tasted bad. They both tasted like they had unripe bananas used which who wants that in their smoothies it threw off the whole taste. I went in the grubhub app to ask for a refund they wouldn‚Äôt for some reason so I figured let me see if the restaurant would maybe refund me or make me another one which they agreed to make me another smoothie. However when I come to get said smoothie they said that grubhub called about the situation and instead of asking what happen they assumed I tried to get a refund on top of a free smoothie. Like honestly I‚Äôm offended and really their smoothies are not that good to try and do all that work for what! You should honor your word and not assume the worst of your customers. They‚Äôre the reason you even have business. You guys won‚Äôt last watch!",

And it‚Äôs such an easy fix, to just add the ability to add an extra side of salad dressing or whatever. Please fix this so I can resume ordering your food. I don‚Äôt always have time to drive there during my work day and parking isn‚Äôt easy, so I prefer to order food for delivery, but won‚Äôt be doing so until I can be sure I‚Äôm getting the meal that I want and have paid quite a bit of money for.
