The bun on the Garlic Burger was fresh and flavorful, and the sauce on the Egg Florentine was so tasty and well-balanced. The French Toast was absolutely awesome ‚Äî perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nThe service was excellent. The staff were all very friendly, welcoming, and attentive, which made the experience even better.\n\nThe interior design is very interesting and cozy. I especially loved the fireplace ‚Äî it adds a warm and charming touch to the atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great spot whether you‚Äôre grabbing brunch or enjoying a casual meal with friends or family.\n\nParking is easy and convenient, and it‚Äôs nice that they also offer a kid‚Äôs menu, making it a family-friendly place.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the area. I‚Äôll be coming back to try more!",

Service was phenomenal.\n\nApparently they haven't changed their main menu in 20+ years so you can count on getting your favorite dishes every time you visit.\n\nThe ambience is so cozy. I love the feeling of being in a big cabin with a fireplace.\n\nThe fries are on par with Bruge's though they don't have such amazing dipping sauces. We like the salmon fish and chips, pierogies, brats, and chicken schnitzel. We got a great blackened chicken sandwich yesterday that was a daily special. Delicious!\n\nThe pretzel and beer cheese is totally worth the $12 dollars.\n\nThe food is pricey but worth splurging for on occasion.\n\nAnd they will give you a free dumpling dessert on your birthday without singing to you!",

Great atmosphere for both beer lovers and casual diners.\n\nWe tried a few of their beers and really enjoyed them, but the standout for me was definitely the Viennese Lager‚Äîsmooth, flavorful, and just the right balance. You can tell they take their brewing seriously here.\n\nFor food, we ordered the Brewmaster‚Äôs Basket, which came with fried calamari and fries‚Äîcrispy, tasty, and perfect for sharing. We also got the chicken wings, and they were delicious‚Äîgreat flavor, cooked just right.\n\nThe service was excellent‚Äîfriendly, fast, and the staff knew their beers well, which is always a plus when you‚Äôre exploring different styles.\n\nOverall, Bohemian Brewery was a great experience from start to finish.
