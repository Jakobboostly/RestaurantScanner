          "text": "Last Friday 07/18/25 my grandson was visiting. He asked for a Gina Maria‚Äôs taco pizza so I ordered one on my credit card. When the guy asked about a tip, I explained that the deliveries under the new owners had been so unreliable that I have stopped tipping until that improves. When the pizza arrived, I was busy, so my grandson answered the door. The delivery driver pressured my grandson to sign for a tip on my credit card. When he appropriately said no, the driver berated him and told him to learn to give tips. Later that day, after my grandson had left, I called and asked for a manager. I complained about the driver and he put me on hold. Another guy with a Mexican accent got on the phone. He was the new owner Ulises and he told me that he was the one that delivered the pizza and berated my grandson. We got into an argument. In my opinion, he has no integrity and is destroying the historic Gina Maria‚Äôs 5 star reputation. The last 8 months I‚Äôve been buying about half my pizzas elsewhere. After this experience I will buy all my pizzas elsewhere. I hope that Ulises goes out of business‚Ä¶\nFYI - Here is my previous review from 11/23/24‚Ä¶\nI‚Äôve been buying Gina Maria‚Äôs pizzas since 1987 (37 years). Throughout the majority of that time, they were family owned and operated and I considered them a 5 star business with 5 star pizza. They finally sold the business and retired. The new owners have failed to maintain the standards previously kept. The last pepperoni & sausage pizza I ordered on 11/09/24 was so spicy hot that it burned our months and we couldn‚Äôt finish it (I threw it in the garbage). Last night I ordered a taco pizza, but it was never delivered. I called 3 times. The first two times I was told they were under-staffed, but that the driver just left with my pizza. The third time I called I asked for a manager. A guy with an accent said that he was a manager and I explained that my pizza was already one hour overdue. He said that the driver was out with my pizza. I told him to cancel the order and to refund my money. He said I could keep the pizza for free when it arrived, but it never came. Although he agreed to refund my money, the charge is still on my credit card today. I called the store just now and the manager on duty today said that yesterday‚Äôs manager did not refund the money, but that she will. I expressed my disappointment in how Gina Maria‚Äôs had declined. She did not disagree. (Note ‚Äì I never got my money back, but I raised enough heck that my next pizza was free)",

I didn't even waste my time to call them, I am just done, they can keep my 32$ from last night because I will never order from Gina's again.\n\nI would have rather gotten a little ceasers $5 pepperoni, at least it would have been cooked, and if Gina's wants to call or email me you got my contact info.",

At least if they had given me an honest delivery time I could have decided which it was not as it arrived overdone in my opinion and cold according to my husband.  Thankfully we have other choices next time and then your delivery person will not be so overworked.",

            "text": "Last Friday 07/18/25 my grandson was visiting. He asked for a Gina Maria‚Äôs taco pizza so I ordered one on my credit card. When the guy asked about a tip, I explained that the deliveries under the new owners had been so unreliable that I have stopped tipping until that improves. When the pizza arrived, I was busy, so my grandson answered the door. The delivery driver pressured my grandson to sign for a tip on my credit card. When he appropriately said no, the driver berated him and told him to learn to give tips. Later that day, after my grandson had left, I called and asked for a manager. I complained about the driver and he put me on hold. Another guy with a Mexican accent got on the phone. He was the new owner Ulises and he told me that he was the one that delivered the pizza and berated my grandson. We got into an argument. In my opinion, he has no integrity and is destroying the historic Gina Maria‚Äôs 5 star reputation. The last 8 months I‚Äôve been buying about half my pizzas elsewhere. After this experience I will buy all my pizzas elsewhere. I hope that Ulises goes out of business‚Ä¶\nFYI - Here is my previous review from 11/23/24‚Ä¶\nI‚Äôve been buying Gina Maria‚Äôs pizzas since 1987 (37 years). Throughout the majority of that time, they were family owned and operated and I considered them a 5 star business with 5 star pizza. They finally sold the business and retired. The new owners have failed to maintain the standards previously kept. The last pepperoni & sausage pizza I ordered on 11/09/24 was so spicy hot that it burned our months and we couldn‚Äôt finish it (I threw it in the garbage). Last night I ordered a taco pizza, but it was never delivered. I called 3 times. The first two times I was told they were under-staffed, but that the driver just left with my pizza. The third time I called I asked for a manager. A guy with an accent said that he was a manager and I explained that my pizza was already one hour overdue. He said that the driver was out with my pizza. I told him to cancel the order and to refund my money. He said I could keep the pizza for free when it arrived, but it never came. Although he agreed to refund my money, the charge is still on my credit card today. I called the store just now and the manager on duty today said that yesterday‚Äôs manager did not refund the money, but that she will. I expressed my disappointment in how Gina Maria‚Äôs had declined. She did not disagree. (Note ‚Äì I never got my money back, but I raised enough heck that my next pizza was free)",

            "text": "I used to absolutely love this place I would have claimed it to be the best pizza place.  However my last 3 experiences in the last 3 years have been horrible.  Including our pizza we ordered last night, after paying 32$ to get a large 2 topping pizza delivered, the pizza still had RAW DOUGH everywhere, only like 15 pepperonis on the whole pizza.  it was almost like they cooked it for half the time in a rush to get the pizza delivered.  I didn't even waste my time to call them, I am just done, they can keep my 32$ from last night because I will never order from Gina's again.\n\nI would have rather gotten a little ceasers $5 pepperoni, at least it would have been cooked, and if Gina's wants to call or email me you got my contact info.",
