Had to wait an extra hour to pick up the pizza we wanted because they had been out of the  Hot Honey sauce since that morning (we ordered in the evening) and the owner was bringing more over. Got to the store to find out that our payment, which was made online at time of order, had been canceled without our knowledge and we had to pay a second time. I had to put the pizza on a credit card since I wasn't anticipating having to pay. A heads up would have nice. And after all that, they were out of the sauce for our wings and had been since that morning according one of the guys in the back. This was also apparently hilarious as the folks in the back were all laughing about it. None of these alone are a huge problem but the whole experience was a mess from start to finish. And as of writing this, the original charge is still on my account, so there may be even more hassle yet to come. The cashier, Daryl, was polite enough and, to his credit, called after I left offering $10 off my next order. It's a hard sell, Daryl. A discount on a future headache? No thanks. First and last time I order here, which is a real shame since the pizza was tasty.",

          "text": "Let me just start off by saying I greatly miss Hungry Howie's...\n\nMy husband and I had never tried BlackJack Pizza before, and this will be the last time we give our business to this location in particular.\n\nWe placed an online order totalling about $49 - We paid with our debit card, and was given an estimated pick up time of 20 minutes. About 10 minutes after ordering, we get a call from a worker at this location telling us that they had run out of Mike's Hot Honey for the pizza we ordered but they had some coming in around 5:30, my husband and I were like \"Yeah, that's fine, no worries, we'll come grab it at 5:30\" We originally placed our order around 4:35 pm. No big deal, big kudos to the worker who called us. Then, once my husband got to the store it was all downhill from there. An older gentleman named Darryl, told us that our order needed to be paid for... ? He stated that since they ran out of hot honey, they voided the whole order... That makes absolutely no sense, since we agreed to wait to pick up the order later when the honey arrived, so my husband paid for the order again on our credit card. But, here's the kicker - the original charge DID post on our debit card, so we are out $98!!! $98!!! Outrageous!! We will be contacting our bank and putting in a fraud complaint and having them help reverse the charge. Also, they had been out of bleu cheese dipping since THAT MORNING so we had nothing for the wings we ordered. Why not let us know that on the phone when you let us know about the hot honey? Darryl had no idea what he was doing and his customer service skills are awful. My husband let him know how frustrated he was and all Darryl could say was.... Nothing.\nDarryl then called my husband while he was on his way home and said that the Owner was giving us a $10 credit on our next order. My husband said \"That's a hard sell, Darryl. I'm not sure about that\". Darryl then responded with \"Well, I did my best so I don't know what you want\". Who talks to customers like that?! $10 credit on a future order that WILL NOT happen at this location ever again. What about my damn $49 I got double charged for?? Insane.\n\nThe pizza and wings were 4/5. The food is great, but not worth $98.....",

About 10 minutes after ordering, we get a call from a worker at this location telling us that they had run out of Mike's Hot Honey for the pizza we ordered but they had some coming in around 5:30, my husband and I were like \"Yeah, that's fine, no worries, we'll come grab it at 5:30\" We originally placed our order around 4:35 pm. No big deal, big kudos to the worker who called us. Then, once my husband got to the store it was all downhill from there. An older gentleman named Darryl, told us that our order needed to be paid for... ? He stated that since they ran out of hot honey, they voided the whole order... That makes absolutely no sense, since we agreed to wait to pick up the order later when the honey arrived, so my husband paid for the order again on our credit card. But, here's the kicker - the original charge DID post on our debit card, so we are out $98!!! $98!!! Outrageous!! We will be contacting our bank and putting in a fraud complaint and having them help reverse the charge. Also, they had been out of bleu cheese dipping since THAT MORNING so we had nothing for the wings we ordered. Why not let us know that on the phone when you let us know about the hot honey? Darryl had no idea what he was doing and his customer service skills are awful. My husband let him know how frustrated he was and all Darryl could say was.... Nothing.\nDarryl then called my husband while he was on his way home and said that the Owner was giving us a $10 credit on our next order. My husband said \"That's a hard sell, Darryl. I'm not sure about that\". Darryl then responded with \"Well, I did my best so I don't know what you want\". Who talks to customers like that?! $10 credit on a future order that WILL NOT happen at this location ever again. What about my damn $49 I got double charged for?? Insane.\n\nThe pizza and wings were 4/5. The food is great, but not worth $98.....",

To no one‚Äôs surprise the pizzas were obviously cold by the time they got to our house, and the manager himself let me know he was the one that forgot all of the sauces. Called the store & asked what‚Äôs going on, the first girl that answered was nice and apologized and offered to refund, only to have her rude/nasty manager take the phone from her and tell me yeah we‚Äôre not doing that & wished me good luck moving forward.\n\nHope that was worth the dispute that we‚Äôll be filing with our bank to reverse the charges. You sure got me, man!\n\nEdit to response below:\n\nFuture customers, be advised a 13 minute drive is out of their delivery range and if you say 1 cuss word after getting cold food delivered an hour and a half after their quoted delivery time you will receive poor customer service. Would also think it would be understandable to be frustrated after 1 nice employee does the right thing and offers to comp the order, only to have her manager say in the background ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôre not doing that‚Äù and steal the phone from her. Don‚Äôt expect accountability, efficiency or friendly people here.",

They did not get the crust right on one of my pizzas. I asked for thin and got some fat bready crust. The other pizza I asked for no red sauce and to use olive oil and garlic sauce instead and extra cheese. What i got was a pizza with red sauce, not a whole lot of cheese, with minced garlic on top of the cheese like it was a topping rather than the sauce base and a drizzle of olive oil over the top of that as well. It was a \"what the heck is this?!\" moment. The staff were nice but Nothing done to fix the order. My next order they finally got the crust type right but it was very hard and hard to chew and hardly any feta when I asked for extra. This location is a letdown so far. They need to reopen Tutt location and/pr retrain their staff here. Blackjack used to be the star of the pizza game in all of Colorado. Now, it is lacking, lacking, lacking. I'd rather spend the $24 on one pizza at a large retail chain like Domino's instead of here. I never thought I'd say that! I'll still give them a try every now and then, but if this keeps going like it is, they'll lose a lot of business. I want them to succeed but this isn't going to accomplish that at the moment. Please keep trying though Blackjack... I've got my fingers crossed for you.",

          "text": "There's been some questionable service at blackjack lately.\nA couple of days ago, I was tired after working a 9 hour shift ( with no lunch break)and really had a hankering for a good meal. I contacted blackjack and wanted to get the specialty pizza deal with 1 free 1-topping pizza. However, i had to go through a series of questions until my deal was accepted...and had to have said coupon to get it. I went ahead and went along with it since the coupons available at King Soopers, but was a little irritated that I had to wait even longer to get my meal. So when I arrived back at the store with the coupon in hand I wanted to speak with a manager about the situation. No one grabbed a manager, but the employee , who handled my order, came over to see what the problem was. I explained my situation and even said I'm paying a little bit more than I was intending to just to get my order. I asked if I had to use a keyword, in the future, or if there's something I need to say in order to avoid this situation. She said \"Yeah just tell us the key word next time.\" I explained that's what I did the first time and I'm still here. Is there anything you can do to make this right? She looked at me puzzled and angry, stating \"What else can I help you with?\" Trying to change the subject. At that point I was like \"Can't you do something to make the situation right?\" She asked me \"What would you want me to do?\" At that point, I shared what do you think would make this right? Eventually a man who appeared( whom I'd assume is the manager) said he was just going to honor the coupon and have my order done. Looking annoyed he shared it's not worth arguing over a pizza. All I wanted was an apology, but at this point, I knew that wasn't going to happen. When they looked at me, after I got my pizzas, they gave me this ugly stare and gave off a feeling like I was a nuisance and clearly wanted me out of the store.  They asked was there anything else I wanted? And I just answered \" Yes, I requested napkins and paper plates for my order.\"The manager grabbed them and sarcastically dropped them on my pizza boxes. I felt like, damn I've been ordering at this location for over 10 years now and I've never been treated this badly. I really hope none of you ever go through what I went through for my order. It wasn't the best treatment I received customer service wise, and it looks like they'd rather have you in/ out of their store then wanting to help you.",

They did not get the crust right on one of my pizzas. I asked for thin and got some fat bready crust. The other pizza I asked for no red sauce and to use olive oil and garlic sauce instead and extra cheese. What i got was a pizza with red sauce, not a whole lot of cheese, with minced garlic on top of the cheese like it was a topping rather than the sauce base and a drizzle of olive oil over the top of that as well. It was a \"what the heck is this?!\" moment. The staff were nice but Nothing done to fix the order. My next order they finally got the crust type right but it was very hard and hard to chew and hardly any feta when I asked for extra. This location is a letdown so far. They need to reopen Tutt location and/pr retrain their staff here. Blackjack used to be the star of the pizza game in all of Colorado. Now, it is lacking, lacking, lacking. I'd rather spend the $24 on one pizza at a large retail chain like Domino's instead of here. I never thought I'd say that! I'll still give them a try every now and then, but if this keeps going like it is, they'll lose a lot of business. I want them to succeed but this isn't going to accomplish that at the moment. Please keep trying though Blackjack... I've got my fingers crossed for you.",

            "text": "Let me just start off by saying I greatly miss Hungry Howie's...\n\nMy husband and I had never tried BlackJack Pizza before, and this will be the last time we give our business to this location in particular.\n\nWe placed an online order totalling about $49 - We paid with our debit card, and was given an estimated pick up time of 20 minutes. About 10 minutes after ordering, we get a call from a worker at this location telling us that they had run out of Mike's Hot Honey for the pizza we ordered but they had some coming in around 5:30, my husband and I were like \"Yeah, that's fine, no worries, we'll come grab it at 5:30\" We originally placed our order around 4:35 pm. No big deal, big kudos to the worker who called us. Then, once my husband got to the store it was all downhill from there. An older gentleman named Darryl, told us that our order needed to be paid for... ? He stated that since they ran out of hot honey, they voided the whole order... That makes absolutely no sense, since we agreed to wait to pick up the order later when the honey arrived, so my husband paid for the order again on our credit card. But, here's the kicker - the original charge DID post on our debit card, so we are out $98!!! $98!!! Outrageous!! We will be contacting our bank and putting in a fraud complaint and having them help reverse the charge. Also, they had been out of bleu cheese dipping since THAT MORNING so we had nothing for the wings we ordered. Why not let us know that on the phone when you let us know about the hot honey? Darryl had no idea what he was doing and his customer service skills are awful. My husband let him know how frustrated he was and all Darryl could say was.... Nothing.\nDarryl then called my husband while he was on his way home and said that the Owner was giving us a $10 credit on our next order. My husband said \"That's a hard sell, Darryl. I'm not sure about that\". Darryl then responded with \"Well, I did my best so I don't know what you want\". Who talks to customers like that?! $10 credit on a future order that WILL NOT happen at this location ever again. What about my damn $49 I got double charged for?? Insane.\n\nThe pizza and wings were 4/5. The food is great, but not worth $98.....",

            "text": "First impression ruined. Use to frequent this location when it  was Hungry Howies and never had a bad experience. Gone are those days, it seems. Had to wait an extra hour to pick up the pizza we wanted because they had been out of the  Hot Honey sauce since that morning (we ordered in the evening) and the owner was bringing more over. Got to the store to find out that our payment, which was made online at time of order, had been canceled without our knowledge and we had to pay a second time. I had to put the pizza on a credit card since I wasn't anticipating having to pay. A heads up would have nice. And after all that, they were out of the sauce for our wings and had been since that morning according one of the guys in the back. This was also apparently hilarious as the folks in the back were all laughing about it. None of these alone are a huge problem but the whole experience was a mess from start to finish. And as of writing this, the original charge is still on my account, so there may be even more hassle yet to come. The cashier, Daryl, was polite enough and, to his credit, called after I left offering $10 off my next order. It's a hard sell, Daryl. A discount on a future headache? No thanks. First and last time I order here, which is a real shame since the pizza was tasty.",
