The most important was to eat the famous Giang Hung- Lay Northern Style. It's pork belly and pork loin in the most delicious tamarind, ginger, garlic, peanuts and more good things sauce. It is divine. My only regret was  too much pork loin and not enough pork belly... my son and I love this pork belly dish,but it was lacking of it. He had none and I had two pieces. Perhaps next time we will make sure it is more belly and less loin... üòâ\nNevertheless, it was delicious... the mango sticky rice was lovely, also.\nSee you soon.",

Everyone at the table raved about those dishes.\nThe service was great, but I would definitely make a reservation to avoid the long wait for walk ins (A better table management would cut down on the wait times significantly.). Didn‚Äôt get the chance to see the patio, but eating inside with the nice decor is the way to do it.\nFinish off dinner with sticky rice and mango.

Our male server never introduced himself, snatched the menus from our hands, and dropped off our food missing the Jasmine rice we had ordered. We had to ask the female server for help instead, but her approach was neither warm nor welcoming.\n\nLater, we waited ten minutes before flagging her down again, but she never returned with the check, which left us having to pay at the front. Once there, we still had to wait another three to four minutes before anyone helped us. Meanwhile, a nearby table used the f-word almost every other sentence, which added to the underwhelming dinner experience.\n\nThe only reason this isn‚Äôt a one-star review is because of the atmosphere and vibe upstairs, which was enjoyable. Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be back to dine in and will instead stick to curbside pickup at the second Thai District location at Partake Kitchen.",
