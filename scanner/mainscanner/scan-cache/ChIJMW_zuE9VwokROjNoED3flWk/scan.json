Not sure if it's coincidence, but every Pizzeria that has a 2 Slices with a Can of Soda for $5, always seem to disappoint with a less than average slice of Pizza. Sadly this was the case with the Pizza. No sauce, greesy slice. However the Crust was above average. Had very good taste and was cooked with a nice crisp. A fresh pizza came out while my 2 slices were heating up. I asked if I could have 2 from the Fresh Pizza, but was denied my request. Always better to taste a fresh pizza. Parking is tough in the area as always.",

The chix franchese was good but the chicken savoy seemed to have a lot of brown gravy from a can, then they add some vinegar to make it \"savoy,\" disappointing.  Their plain pizza was voted best pizza, so we tried it... For our taste it was not the best pizza. We like our pizza crust to fold nicely when it's fresh out of the oven rather than crack when folded.... Insufficient amount of toppings too. The portions are large that's a good thing; food for the next meal is always appreciated, alas if the food isn't good.... ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

The chix franchese was good but the chicken savoy seemed to have a lot of brown gravy from a can, then they add some vinegar to make it \"savoy,\" disappointing.  Their plain pizza was voted best pizza, so we tried it... For our taste it was not the best pizza. We like our pizza crust to fold nicely when it's fresh out of the oven rather than crack when folded.... Insufficient amount of toppings too. The portions are large that's a good thing; food for the next meal is always appreciated, alas if the food isn't good.... ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

Sadly this was the case with the Pizza. No sauce, greesy slice. However the Crust was above average. Had very good taste and was cooked with a nice crisp. A fresh pizza came out while my 2 slices were heating up. I asked if I could have 2 from the Fresh Pizza, but was denied my request. Always better to taste a fresh pizza. Parking is tough in the area as always.",
