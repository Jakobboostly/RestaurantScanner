The prices are fair, the portions are generous, and the flavor never disappoints. I believe they may have changed ownership recently, but the quality has stayed consistent, which says a lot. I also appreciate the occasional discount texts they send out.

The woman at the front desk (an older lady with glasses) was extremely rude, unprofessional, and absolutely unhygienic. She had no manners in dealing with customers and even walked into the kitchen with dirty hands. That is beyond disgusting.\n\nNo matter how good a pizza might taste, customers will never return if the staff is rude and the hygiene is this bad. Respect, cleanliness, and proper behavior should come before anything ‚Äî but here, you get none of that.\n\nManagement seriously needs to rethink who they put at the front desk and near food.

          "text": "Stay away from this pizza store!\nThis was by far the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had at any food place. The woman at the front desk (an older lady with glasses) was extremely rude, unprofessional, and absolutely unhygienic. She had no manners in dealing with customers and even walked into the kitchen with dirty hands. That is beyond disgusting.\n\nNo matter how good a pizza might taste, customers will never return if the staff is rude and the hygiene is this bad. Respect, cleanliness, and proper behavior should come before anything ‚Äî but here, you get none of that.\n\nManagement seriously needs to rethink who they put at the front desk and near food. Until that happens, avoid this place at all costs if you care about your health, your food, and basic respect.",

We waited in there for a bit, talking loudly to get someone's attention, but nothing. No one else was in there and they were open for several more hours, so I'm not sure why we weren't helped. While we were standing there, we saw shoes piled up by the door to the back. Not really a clean look. We ended up walking out and going to a different restaurant. Maybe put a bell in the front door, so you know when someone walks in. It's also a safety hazard for your workers.",

That is beyond disgusting.\n\nNo matter how good a pizza might taste, customers will never return if the staff is rude and the hygiene is this bad. Respect, cleanliness, and proper behavior should come before anything ‚Äî but here, you get none of that.\n\nManagement seriously needs to rethink who they put at the front desk and near food.
