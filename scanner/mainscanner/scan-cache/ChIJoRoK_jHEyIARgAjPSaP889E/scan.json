          "text": "This ended up being our favorite restaurant of the entire trip‚Äîwe loved it so much that I‚Äôm already planning to come back next month!\n\nI‚Äôll admit, I was a little nervous when I saw the low Google rating. But I also noticed how hard it was to get a reservation, so I took a chance. I did have to wait about 30 minutes even with a reservation, which wasn‚Äôt ideal‚Äîbut everything after that more than made up for it.\n\nThe food was incredible. I loved the spicy vodka sauce, and the veal Parmesan (especially the bone) was a standout. The drinks were just as impressive‚Äîhands down the best espresso martini I‚Äôve ever had.\n\nService was top-notch. Richard and William were both attentive, warm, and fun‚Äîthey even did a little whiskey tasting with us. They really helped make the night special.",

The breads were nice and warm and very very tasty, they gave a decent serving of parmesan cheese to go with it and it was really good. The portions are pretty big and it's mostly family style so you can order a couple dishes and share. The pasta portions were good for one or two people but the entree like the chicken dish was huge.",

They could definitely use some help in the interior design department as the tables are quite uncomfortable. Although it‚Äôs a cool look and aesthetically pleasing, the uncomfortable seating is to the point where it takes away from the experience. I‚Äôll still give this a five star review because it really is that good. It‚Äôs of course extremely expensive but it‚Äôs a hotel casino in Vegas and that‚Äôs how they are these days. I hope they continue to pursue excellence in their menu because there are some dishes with some slight room from improvement, but most of all I really hope they improve their interior design. Specifically in the aspect of comfort.",

The complimentary bread was AMAZING the pizza foccacia was divine. The caesar salad is definitely anchovy heavy, not quite to my taste but my partner really enjoyed. The rigatoni vodka was extremely salty and I sent back for a lite-salt version, which they were more than happy to accommodate and remake. Overall the ambience is lovely - the food is on the saltier side but it was a great experience!",

Our captain basically ignored us all night, but was attentive with tables all around us. He only checked on us once the food arrived.

The food was mediocre at best and too pretentious. The spaghetti pomodoro did not have a red sauce. It was noodles with some tomatoes.  The veal Marsala was not the thin veal cutlets most restaurants do. Instead, it was Big chunks of meat and mushrooms with a sauce that was not great.  They did take that off the bill which was nice. If you want good Italian food in Vegas there are better less expensive options.  Try Capos. It is off strip but everything we have tried there was amazing.",

Carbone imposes a two hour dining limit, but they ran 30 minutes late on seating us for our confirmed reservation.  In the meantime, they don‚Äôt allow you to order drinks at the bar and the bartender is a first class jerk.  What Vegas establishment passes up selling $30 drinks?  Carbone is very loud and definitely not for a romantic dinner.  We complained several times about the table next to us who were in near fisticuffs fighting and shouting at each other.  Thinking someone could get hit any minute was beyond tense.  The food quality is subpar.  The ribs were overcooked and overspiced.  The pasta was cold.  The bread service was the best part of the meal.  In all, this is an overrated restaurant and not worth the effort it takes to secure a reservation.",

          "text": "Just so you know.. they won't seat you until your entire party arrives. So, don't be surprised if they won't seat you.\n\nAnyway, when everyone finally arrived, we were taken through a maze of different rooms until we finally took our seats in a dimly lit area, adorned with lovely, red velvety curtains.  This location is about 2500% bigger than the one in NYC.\n\nThe service was tight, but I'd say that our server could've turned it down about 25% to less talky.  Otherwise, nice professional staff that included at least three different members catering to us.\n\nWith three in our group, we started with drinks.. a Spicy Margherita, a Cosmopolitan, and I ordered a wonderful medium bodied glass of Cabernet, before originally tasting an even more outstanding and full bodied one, that was over $70.  I settled for the $40 glass which was still absolutely delicious.\n\nThe menus were very large for the amount of writing that was on them.\n\nAs a starter to the table they sent us a basket of different breads, with focaccia, toasted garlic, and a nice sesame seeded semolina, all of which were outstanding.  Also complimentary, was a plate of capicola/salami, which went well with the breads.\n\nWe added nine baked little neck clams that had three different styles. A classic oregonato, which tasted fine, but maybe a little drier than expected. The other was a clams casino style, then there was my favorite.. the raw one, which tasted best to me overall.  With a squirt of lemon onto a decent amount of meat, these clams were delicious.\n\nWe shared the prosciutto with melon, which included both cantaloupe and honeydew.  Melons were sweet and the prosciutto succulently salty, making for a delicious combination.\n\nWe shared a deliciously crisp Caesar Salad and a Spicy Rigatoni Vodka, that was cooked to perfection and very easy to just devour.  I included an order of the broccoli rabe, which was possibly the best I've ever had.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, but enjoyed a coffee to help us stay up for a little bit of midnight gambling.  The desserts looked great and were probably as delicious as everything else was.  Pricey, but delicious.",

          "text": "A Disappointing Dining Experience\n\nI walked in with high expectations, only to leave with disappointment. I took my wife and mother out for what was supposed to be a nice dinner.\n\nThe issues began right when we placed our order. We wanted to try a variety of dishes to sample different flavors, including their signature Porterhouse steak. I asked our server about the portion sizes to make sure we weren‚Äôt ordering too much. Instead of giving a clear answer, he insisted we also order his personal favorite‚Äîthe New York strip‚Äîdespite my concerns about the quantity. He reassured me it wouldn‚Äôt be too much, so we agreed.\n\nAfter taking our order, the server essentially disappeared. He spent most of the evening chatting with another table, who seemed to be his friends, and never once checked in to see if we needed anything. In a fine dining restaurant, attentive service is expected, but that was not the case here.\n\nWhen the food began arriving, support staff practically tossed the plates onto our table without a word. To make matters worse, my mother‚Äôs chair wobbled the entire time. I initially thought the floor was uneven, but it turned out one of the legs was simply shorter. When I told the server, he casually told us to switch chairs ourselves. I suggested he do it, and while he eventually swapped it with a nearby chair, he left the broken one sitting there.\n\nAs for the food‚Äîappetizers and bread were fine, but the pasta was unimpressive. Both the Porterhouse and the New York strip we ordered medium came out closer to well-done, dry, and difficult to eat. The server never asked if the steaks were cooked to our liking and never checked in after they arrived. The portions were enormous, far more than we could eat, and he didn‚Äôt even ask if we wanted more wine. He was too busy talking to the other table, who, I later noticed, were apparently well-known, as several staff members were taking photos with them.\n\nWe ended up barely touching the steaks and had to wait quite a while to get them boxed to go. He didn‚Äôt even ask if we wanted dessert. By that point, we just wanted to leave.\n\nThe bill came to over $700. I‚Äôm normally a generous tipper, but for the first time, I questioned whether the server deserved anything at all. Out of basic courtesy, I still left $100.\n\nAs someone who frequently visits Las Vegas to enjoy great food and has dined at many restaurants, this was by far one of the worst dinners I‚Äôve ever had.",

The food wasn‚Äôt hot especially their special pasta the carbine pasta. We didn‚Äôt get drinks for 45 minutes. They left dirty plates on our table after being done with food and argued with us when we asked our clean plates for our salad after having seafood and other remnants on our plate. They said we should only get one plate for all the courses before the salad.  The main part of the restaurant feels like you‚Äôre in a low end restaurant.  The back room is a little nicer.  I would never recommend anyone waste their time going and eating at this restaurant when there‚Äôs so many better options in town.  Not worth the price at all.",

          "text": "One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.\n\nWe had an amazing dinner at Carbone Dallas a couple years ago and were really looking forward to visiting Carbone Las Vegas for months leading up to our trip.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant about 25 min before our reservation.  I checked in with the host and was told 'your table is no where near ready.  Try back at your reservation time.'  I thought that was a little weird.  Most restaurants atleast will offer getting drinks at the bar while waiting for a table.  We went down to the casino until closer to our reservation time.\n\nWe arrived back at the restaurant at our reservation time and checked back in with the host again.  She asked to wait a couple more minutes before finally being able to take us to our table.\n\nWe watched as tables around us that were seated after us were greeted and handed menus.  After about 15 min a back waiter came and asked us if we wanted to order drinks.  (We were still not offered a menu).  Finally after about 25 min, our server finally came to the table handed us menus and then immediately said \"so do you know what you want to order\".  We said that since we were just handed the menus we'd need a couple of min to look at it.\nAfter about 5 min, our server returned to take our order.  Once again we were asked 'so do know what you want'.  We mentioned that we had some amazing meatballs at Carbone Dallas that were on special and asked if they had any specials for the evening.  Our server than rudely says 'of couse.  we are known for our specials'.  It was followed by awkward silence where we were waiting for him to tell us the specials.  We had to then ask 'well are you able to tell us what the specials are.'  The server finally told us the specials.   We asked about a couple of the dishes again cause it was really hard to hear him, but ended up just ordering off the menu.  When it came to ordering the Shrimp Su'modo dish, our server cut us off and just said 'scampi'.  My partner said 'oh it says shrimp su'modo'.  The server rudely said 'that means for you.  but we can cook it scampi style'.  I said well if that's how it comes, that would be great.  He then said 'no we offer it 3 different ways.'  I asked him if he could tell us about those 3 different ways since I didn't see it on the menu how that could be done.  He seemed to roll his eyes at us and tell us the 3 different names of styles it could be cooked.  I wasn't familiar with the other ways he said, so I asked if he could tell us more about those styles.  He once again rolled his eyes at us.   At this point, we were both very frustrated with the service.\n\nWe watched as food started coming out to tables that were seated and ordered after us from the same server.  Finally our appetizers started to come out over 1 hour after we had been seated.   I had to flag down a back waiter to try and put in another drink order as it seemed no one was coming to check on our table.\n\nThankfully the food was actually good, but the lack of service and horrible service when someone finally did come to our table left us really wanting to get out of there.  I tried to flag down our server and the back waiter to see if we could get our check to leave.  I finally had to flag down what seemed to be a manager in a suit to ask for our check.  When we were about to be handed our check, the server returned and tried to take away the check and said 'but wait, you haven't gotten your rainbow cookies'.  I let him know we were ready to leave now and didn't want to wait.\n\nHonestly this dinner was the biggest disappointment and I cannot stress how bad service was.  With so many great dining options in Las Vegas, please go somewhere that wants your business.",

          "text": "The Aria‚Äôs restaurants leave little to be desired EXCEPT for Carbone. The service and the food left this party of four hungry and dissatisfied, so much so that I would leave 0 stars if possible. My family and I came to Carbone hungry and eager. We had tried to eat at the restaurant a year prior without reservations and were disappointed when we realized how busy the restaurant was. This year, we decided to make reservations in advance to get into the highly regarded restaurant. Our reservations were at 8:30pm. We waited for 45 minutes to be seated despite our reservation time. We understood that the time other patrons take to eat is not in the control of the staff, so initially we did not find this to be a big deal. Once seated, we waited 20 minutes for our server to greet us and then another 30 minutes to receive the restaurants complimentary antipasto (bread, salami, and cauliflower). We watched as many other guests seated after us received this antipasto well before us. When our main course arrived it was luke warm at best. The food was fine. The taste wasn‚Äôt exceptional, especially for the price tag, but what was really disappointing was the service. We watched as many other people received their food with gorgeous table side service. Servers were cutting fish table side and serving it to the other patrons. We ordered the Branzino and when our fish arrived, no one offered to cut it. We had to ask our server and he looked appalled that we wanted our fish cut. After tasting the fish, it was quite frankly one of the worst fish dishes we have ever had. Our server only touched the table three times during the course of our meal. We understand that the restaurant is very busy and popular, but the service left much to be desired. We asked the bartender for the manager twice before he came to the table. He seemed bothered by our concerns and didn‚Äôt address the issues as needed. In the end, the issues were not amended properly. They took the Branzino and the veal (another dish that our whole table did not find enjoyable) off of the check.  They offered us a mediocre dessert and we still paid over $300 for a very average meal. I would not recommend this Carbone location to anyone. The service is inconsistent and the food is not as good as the price tag and popularity would suggest. We were very displeased.  If you are looking for a great meal I would avoid this place and seek elsewhere, like the neighbor Jean George Steak House.",

The food in my opinion is okay it isn‚Äôt the best or the worst. The service is horrible that is a fact rudeness from start to finish if you can still enjoy your meal after every staff member you encounter being rude to you then you 100% should eat here. The wait time even with a reservation is also long.

Seemed like he was angry we didn't order a expensive dinner meal instead of side dishes.  What blew my mind was how expensive there shrimp cocktail is. $40 for 5 shrimp that were large. Not XL but just little over average size. No where did on the menu did it say 40$or I would have never got them. And besides the price they were horrible. Didn't seem fresh, we're kind of hard and this red seasoning to them. This place just seems way overpriced and while the other dishes were good,  nothing blew me away. I hate to drop 200 on a dinner when you have these hidden prices, below avergae service which was good for the 1st 30 min and then fell flat to bad.  As a server you take our order, get our drinks, everyone else brings the food and refills water and then you show at the end for your tip. Must be nice to have everyone else do your work for you and you get the tip... I will never go back to this place.. there are other spots to go.",

We were all return customers ready to spend on food wine and cocktails.\n\nFirst hurdle: My friend who made reservation texted to let them know we were running late. We arrived at 6:48pm, 3 minutes after our communicated arrival time (and their standard 15 minute grace period).\n\nNot only was the hostess rude, dismissive, passive aggressive, and completely unaccommodating, she seemed please and almost gleeful to find any reason to turn us away (3 minutes late).\n\nTo top it off, I (being the only male in a group with 4 women) was told I wasn‚Äôt allowed in because I was wearing open toed shoes (designer peep-toe flats, which matched my girlfriends‚Äô shoes). Apparently they have a strict dress code for well dressed men to not wear the slightest open toed shoes‚Ä¶but women can.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager about this, and just like the hostess, she seemed glad to tell me I couldn‚Äôt dine here (without any valid justification - just a fake sneer on her face saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs our policy‚Äù). Meanwhile men wearing casual workout running shoes walked in and out of the restaurant around us.\n\nAs repeat customers and friends and family of repeat customers, Carbone made it very clear that we are not welcome. We will not be spending another dime at any Carbone.\n\nI would‚Äôve given 0 stars if I could. Perhaps Google should consider that as an option.",

While the service was decent, the kitchen was painfully slow ‚Äî **we waited nearly an hour** for our food to arrive. When we asked why it was taking so long, our server explained that the chef didn‚Äôt like how our first ribeye came out and decided to remake it. Honestly, that sounded more like an excuse than the truth.\n\nBy the time the food finally hit the table, **we had all lost our appetite**. The meal itself was average at best, and certainly **not worth the \\$500 bill**. For that kind of price, I expected exceptional food and a seamless experience ‚Äî not long waits, questionable excuses, and lukewarm entrees.\n\n**Bottom line:** Carbone might have the name and vibe, but the food and execution don‚Äôt match the hype.

          "text": "As someone who was very excited about trying this restaurant who waited weeks to secure a reservation and paid a $75 reservation fee, I expected a high standard of service that matched the restaurant‚Äôs reputation and price point. Unfortunately, my experience was anything but.\n\nFrom the start, our server seemed more focused on delivering the well-rehearsed script of the night‚Äôs specials than actually listening to our specific requests. We made it very clear that we were not sharing a pasta dish, that I wanted pasta as my entr√©e, and that my partner would be ordering the salmon. Despite this, we were brought pasta, asparagus, and no salmon at all. We waited patiently for the mistake to be corrected, only to later be asked if we wanted dessert without any acknowledgment that a major part of our meal had never arrived.\n\nTo be told we never ordered the salmon was both shocking and frustrating. We were very specific in our communication, and it was disappointing to feel ignored. It seemed like the staff were more concerned with following a rigid dining format than listening to what we, the paying guests, wanted. I understand the restaurant aims for a curated experience, but that should not come at the cost of attentiveness or flexibility.\n\nTo make matters worse, on our way out, we passed a group of at least five staff members standing at the front. Not one of them acknowledged our presence, said thank you, or even made eye contact. For a restaurant of this caliber, this level of indifference is unacceptable. Even fast food establishments are more consistent in thanking their guests. There were other issues but these were worth the time I spent gathering my words.\n\nI will say, on a positive note, the rigatoni was phenomenal and lived up to the hype truly the highlight of the evening. However, a single excellent dish does not make up for the disjointed and disappointing service experience that overshadowed the rest of our meal.\nA restaurant charging premium prices and requiring a paid reservation should deliver not only excellent food, but equally attentive and respectful service. Sadly, this visit fell far short.",

We‚Äôre pretty easygoing people and I‚Äôve never written a bad review before, but we walked in there excited for a good meal and walked away feeling insulted and confused.\n\nWe were seated and never asked about drinks or told about specials. Our waiter walked up to our table, stood there silently, no greeting or verbal prompt, and after a few awkward moments lifted his shoulders and said ‚ÄúSo are you going to order?‚Äù. We ordered the caprese salad, dover sole, and a side of corn. I asked for a glass of wine, which apparently offended our server because he literally responded ‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù and told me that it would numb my lips too much to enjoy the fish and he would never do that, but he‚Äôd bring it out to me anyway. I appreciate his intent of trying to guide me on the best pairing to enjoy the meal, but was surprised at the direct and almost rude communication style.\n\nI will say that there was a sweet elderly lady dining solo seated next to us that seemed like a frequent visitor, and several staff members stopped to chat with her, even sitting down across from her to converse. So, we did witness other staff members being kind to patrons. The food tasted great, but was overshadowed by the horrible service. There are so many other great restaurants in Vegas that offer a more consistent and pleasant experience, we will never be visiting this Carbone‚Äôs location again.",

The rigatoni was the start like many others have claimed. The secret star was the focaccia bread with a slight layer of sauce on top that they bring out at the beginning. That was my favorite for sure! The meatballs were perfect. The Tiramisu was a Tiramisu cake and not true Tiramisu which they didn‚Äôt specify; it was okay. The cocktail was not good. I got a Manhattan and it was straight up a punch in the face of alcohol and didn‚Äôt taste like there was anything mixed in. Overall it was good!

Seemed like he was angry we didn't order a expensive dinner meal instead of side dishes.  What blew my mind was how expensive there shrimp cocktail is. $40 for 5 shrimp that were large. Not XL but just little over average size. No where did on the menu did it say 40$or I would have never got them. And besides the price they were horrible. Didn't seem fresh, we're kind of hard and this red seasoning to them. This place just seems way overpriced and while the other dishes were good,  nothing blew me away. I hate to drop 200 on a dinner when you have these hidden prices, below avergae service which was good for the 1st 30 min and then fell flat to bad.  As a server you take our order, get our drinks, everyone else brings the food and refills water and then you show at the end for your tip. Must be nice to have everyone else do your work for you and you get the tip... I will never go back to this place.. there are other spots to go.",

He (no introduction) listed the specials he could remember, missing the lobster cocktail, among others, which sounded amazing when we got to hear about them listening to Athena deliver them to the table next to ours.\n\nWe selected the caprese salad, because I saw on the menu, that was not mentioned to us as their seasonal special with freshly made mozzarella and seasonal vine riped tomatoes...which we learned listening to other tables receiving recommendations.\nOur Captain only came to check-in on us during the 30-45 minute wait between our pasta and $150 NY strip while we sat with empty white plates in front of us, frowning, as we listened to the amazing experience the table next to us was receiving.\nSo...after seeing our table neighbor's meal order (that was identical to our own) arrive with reasonable timing between dishes, after they'd received beautifully delivered recommendations, and enjoyed frequent table check-ins from their Captain to ensure their satisfaction, I asked our server, (who was great) to speak with management. Once management arrived, they listened to my polite summary and stated they agreed with me that the Captain working the table next to us, Athena, was the Superhero of the establishment and ours needed a time-out for additional training. I felt better for getting to vent, but received no apology or reasonable accomodation towards the $500 meal-for-two experience disaster we'd just endured.\nWe decided to skip desert and get the hell out of the establishment. We left 20% gratuity as our server, Keith, was amazingly attentive in watching our beverage refills, clearing plates, and efforts trying to connect... perhaps in response to what was lacking from our table Captain. We hope Keith's promoted to an establishment that deserves him as Carbone is a $500 dinner-for-two disaster unless sitting in Athena's section.",
