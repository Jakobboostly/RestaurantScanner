The host would have been a better server than this guy. Well, the food came out, and it looked good till I tried the steak it had no flavor so much fat on it I could have lube my truck with it. The pork chop was dry and hard and had no flavor. The only thing that was great was the hash browns toast sauage and eggs, and the bacon was amazing. The check came from the host, not the server. I took it, he didn't care about the customer. Would not return here. Sorry, it is what is......",

It comes with hash browns which are covered with cheese and toast. It's a filling breakfast. The coffee is average.\n\nService is fast and friendly. The space is nicely decorated and includes both tables and booths. There are a few TVs. They do have password protected Wi-Fi. There's also a patio out back.\n\nThere's plenty of parking in the lot in front of the restaurant.",

The breakfast burrito was tiny and next to it a ridiculous side of hashbrowns. Although they did smother everything with a good amount of green chili, NOTHING was seasoned. The chili was as bland as could be. The inside of the burrito was completely bland, the hashbrowns didn't even taste salted. As for the cinnamon roll, I don't think it actually qualifies as one. The dough looked like a box-mix bread dough, upon tasting it, I'm pretty positive it WAS a box-mix bread dough. Entirely disappointed in the food from every perspective.",

Bacon is a strong taste, so I was happy to find the chicken wasn't overseasoned so they could mesh together correctly. The filling was portioned out so there weren't any empty bites. It wasn't too heavy or too light. Overall it was a very satifsying lunch meal.",

It was plenty for us.  My husband ordered steak and eggs and was happy with his.  The only negative I'd give, and maybe it was just a mishap on this day, it was so hot inside I didn't want to drink my coffee.  I was slightly sweating the entire time I ate.
