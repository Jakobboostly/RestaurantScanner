The portions are huge and we can't wait to enjoy a nice lunch. The garlic knots were a nice treat as well!\n\nMax informed us that Roma's has been in The Colony for 23 years. He was a gracious host!

The Chicken Genovese tasted like fish, the bread is stale and tastes awful (I didn't know bread could taste that bad). And the cheese sticks look frozen and have zero flavor. We will never make the mistake of ordering from here again.",

The reviews are accurate in that the house made salad dressing was good enough to drink. The pink sauce is to die for on any entree.\n\nWe got the pasta sampler and a calzone. Both were amazing! The portions are huge and we can't wait to enjoy a nice lunch. The garlic knots were a nice treat as well!\n\nMax informed us that Roma's has been in The Colony for 23 years. He was a gracious host! We can't wait to visit again!",

All the other food is standard Italian fair. When they ask if you want salad pass on it. It doesn't come with the meal and is not much of a salad. There is always classic Italian music as well wich I enjoy.",
