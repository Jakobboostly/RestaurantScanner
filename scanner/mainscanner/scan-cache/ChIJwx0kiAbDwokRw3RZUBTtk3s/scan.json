          "text": "Came here for the first time, and I didn't have a great experience. Upon walking in, there was no hostess. We waited there for a few minutes & then she finally came out from the kitchen.  It took a very long time before anyone came to our table to serve us. When we finally ordered our drinks, it took over 20 minutes before we got our drinks. This is also not a very big restaurant, and it wasn't very busy, so there's no reason for the long waits. Our waitress wasn't very attentive, nor was she very friendly.  The food took a very long time to come out. I was disappointed with my meal, and I did not like it at all, so I did not eat it. My son ordered a chicken sandwich and the cut of chicken was so thick, and unpleasant. He did not like his meal either. No one at our party said that their meal was very good. $250 later, no one was happy with their meal, service was slow and we had a not so cordial waitress.  I don't see the hype in some of these reviews. I've had so many good meals from other local restaurants, such as Blu Fig for half the price.  Bellissimo in Montvale has amazing food, good service and a great atmosphere, and our bill has never come up that high.  I had high hopes for Gio's, but after the bad experience with the poor service, from the moment of walking in, unusually long waits for everything, and the low quality food, I unfortunately will not be returning. I am one that will become a regular if the food and service are good, but this place will not be added to my list of restaurants that I frequent. I honestly wish I would've just sent my meal and my son's meal back to the kitchen, instead of paying for it and staying hungry.  There were 2 restaurants before Gio's, and none of them lasted very long. I can't see them lasting very long. I was so disappointed, and wasted so much money and was still hungry at the end of the night.  I hope management learns something from this review. As an entrepreneur, reviews are paramount because it gives you a real view of what's really going on in areas where you might've miss, and it highlights the areas where improvements are needed.",

Our waitress was wonderful, as soon as we sat down we were greeted, asked for drinks, and soon after appetizers and our entrees. We didn't wait long in between meals. As far as food goes, I got the bronzino filet which was grilled, healthy, light in oil. My husband got chicken parm and pasta and that was cooked well. Highly reccomend the blackened salmon.",
