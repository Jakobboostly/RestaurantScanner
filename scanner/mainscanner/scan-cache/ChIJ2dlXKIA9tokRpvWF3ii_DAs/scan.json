Either way, it meant the meal just wasn't impressive.\n\nOur experience favored the Mediterranean foods over the Italian. The tomato sauce was a bit bland, the pizza a bit bland, the caprese a bit bland. Not bad, just... Not impressive. The gyro and Greek salads were good. Perhaps had I also eaten shawarma this would have been a better review.\n\nService was fine, but we entered at the start of a rush and the wait staff felt a little overworked. But even with that I had no complaints about the service.\n\nOverall, I'd try Mama Luccis again, but it would be the last chance to wow me.",

I ordered a falafel gyro with French fries and my friend ordered the veal parmigiana. Baklava and Chocolate cake for desert. Food was delicious, deserts were great. Overall a solid performance in choice, service, flavor, decor and overall value. Looking forward to returning on my next visit to the area.",

Either way, it meant the meal just wasn't impressive.\n\nOur experience favored the Mediterranean foods over the Italian. The tomato sauce was a bit bland, the pizza a bit bland, the caprese a bit bland. Not bad, just... Not impressive. The gyro and Greek salads were good. Perhaps had I also eaten shawarma this would have been a better review.\n\nService was fine, but we entered at the start of a rush and the wait staff felt a little overworked. But even with that I had no complaints about the service.\n\nOverall, I'd try Mama Luccis again, but it would be the last chance to wow me.",
