I have yet to try the pizza, but based on how much I enjoyed the Parmesan's salad, I will be trying their pizza soon!\nAte here with two friends the first week of April and each of us were thrilled with our choices. The large, Parmesan's salad is so filling and packed with fresh, delicious ingredients! I even added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the second half of my salad which took it to another level. One friend enjoyed her buffalo wings commenting how nicely prepared they were for her. Our other friend was full after enjoying the hot Italian sub on freshly baked bread. All 3 of us really enjoyed our tasty meals. We came in for an early lunch and were thankful it wasn't too busy. They also have a nice patio / deck with an overview of beautiful Table Rock Lake in the distance. We're planning on a return trip soon to try some freshly made pizza at Parmesan's. Surely it'll be a treat.",

My husband always orders a small pizza. He has leftover pizza also.\nLove this restaurant!! It‚Äôs fun to dine in also. They have a beautiful remodeled deck to eat on. Has a beautiful view of the lake!!\nPrices are reasonable. If you do pickup, you don‚Äôt have to leave a tip. You can save by doing this.\nTry this delicious restaurant!!

We decided to order a Large Sicilian Pizza along with some cheesy breadsticks.\n\nThe cheesy breadsticks were amazing. They had ample amounts of cheese and were quite plentiful portion wise. I enjoyed the burnt cheese in the outside while the center was cheesy and soft.\n\nThe Sicilian Pizza was very delicious. The pizza was cooked to perfection with a toasted crust on the outside. I am told that the pizza dough is homemade and based on the first bite, it was quite apparent. You could most certainly taste the quality which is leaps and bounds above any chain pizza restaurant.\n\nLastly, the service was wonderful. Our waitress, who I am assuming was the owner was incredibly kind and was attentive to our needs. I highly recommend stopping by if you are in the area and want a wonderful Italian experience with an authentic, rural charm.",

I have yet to try the pizza, but based on how much I enjoyed the Parmesan's salad, I will be trying their pizza soon!\nAte here with two friends the first week of April and each of us were thrilled with our choices. The large, Parmesan's salad is so filling and packed with fresh, delicious ingredients! I even added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the second half of my salad which took it to another level. One friend enjoyed her buffalo wings commenting how nicely prepared they were for her. Our other friend was full after enjoying the hot Italian sub on freshly baked bread. All 3 of us really enjoyed our tasty meals. We came in for an early lunch and were thankful it wasn't too busy. They also have a nice patio / deck with an overview of beautiful Table Rock Lake in the distance. We're planning on a return trip soon to try some freshly made pizza at Parmesan's. Surely it'll be a treat.",

Placed a to go order. Should have looked in the bag. It was wrong and we had to go back. No apology seemed as though they could care less. Definitely won't recommend or go back. Live down the road. What a shame used to be so nice. Now just Sad",
