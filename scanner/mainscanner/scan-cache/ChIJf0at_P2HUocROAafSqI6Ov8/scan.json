          "text": "I've been curious to try this Italian restaurant as I drive past it every day, and it did not disappoint! The vibe was chill and cozy. The wine list is great. We started with the calamari, which was well seasoned and breaded. I had the veal marsala with the daily soup. The daily soup was average. The veal marsala, however, was amazing. The sauce it comes with is delicious. My husband chose the clam linguini with the salad, which was good. The clam was quite tasty. For dessert, we had the chocobella cake, but unfortunately, it was also just average. I'm not sure if the chocolate cake is made in-house or bought from somewhere else, but for $10, I was expecting the cake to be better. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and know what to get again next time we visit and what to stay away from.",

          "text": "Always Worth the Drive ‚Äî Comforting, Classic Italian with Heart\n\nFratelli Italian Food has been one of my go-to spots for years‚Äîand it never disappoints. Whether it‚Äôs date night, dinner with friends, or a bigger group outing, this place consistently delivers delicious food, warm service, and that homey, family-run charm that‚Äôs getting harder to find.\n\nI always recommend calling ahead for a reservation, especially if you‚Äôre rolling in with more than two people. They‚Äôve got plenty of room for larger groups (huge plus!), but I like the peace of mind knowing we‚Äôve got a table waiting.\n\nWe tend to start every meal the same way‚Äîwith their antipasto board, and honestly, why mess with perfection? It‚Äôs a beautiful spread of deli meats, cheeses, olives, sweet peppers, and this time, perfectly cooked asparagus. It‚Äôs shareable, satisfying, and the kind of appetizer that feels like an occasion in itself.\n\nEntrees come with a salad, and the house-made feta dressing is always our pick. Creamy, tangy, and addictive‚Äîit‚Äôs reason enough to clean your plate.\n\nFor my main dish, I went with the chicken piccata, and it was a win: tender, bright with lemon, and generously portioned. Between the caper-forward sauce and the size of the plate, it was a win for both my appetite and leftovers the next day. My other half ordered the veal marsala, which is rich and satisfying‚Äîjust know it leans a bit sweet. Our friend went with the spaghetti and meatballs, which feels like Fratelli‚Äôs unofficial signature dish. Always classic, always comforting.\n\nTheir wine list leans Italian, of course, and it‚Äôs well-curated‚Äîplenty of great options by the glass or bottle. I only managed a couple photos this time because, full honesty‚Ä¶ I was way too excited to eat. Fratelli is a bit of a drive from home, and when you‚Äôre craving comforting Italian in a space that feels like family‚Äîyou make the trip.\n\nLooking for that mom-and-pop magic with consistently good food, generous portions, and a welcoming vibe? This is your spot.",

          "text": "Always Worth the Drive ‚Äî Comforting, Classic Italian with Heart\n\nFratelli Italian Food has been one of my go-to spots for years‚Äîand it never disappoints. Whether it‚Äôs date night, dinner with friends, or a bigger group outing, this place consistently delivers delicious food, warm service, and that homey, family-run charm that‚Äôs getting harder to find.\n\nI always recommend calling ahead for a reservation, especially if you‚Äôre rolling in with more than two people. They‚Äôve got plenty of room for larger groups (huge plus!), but I like the peace of mind knowing we‚Äôve got a table waiting.\n\nWe tend to start every meal the same way‚Äîwith their antipasto board, and honestly, why mess with perfection? It‚Äôs a beautiful spread of deli meats, cheeses, olives, sweet peppers, and this time, perfectly cooked asparagus. It‚Äôs shareable, satisfying, and the kind of appetizer that feels like an occasion in itself.\n\nEntrees come with a salad, and the house-made feta dressing is always our pick. Creamy, tangy, and addictive‚Äîit‚Äôs reason enough to clean your plate.\n\nFor my main dish, I went with the chicken piccata, and it was a win: tender, bright with lemon, and generously portioned. Between the caper-forward sauce and the size of the plate, it was a win for both my appetite and leftovers the next day. My other half ordered the veal marsala, which is rich and satisfying‚Äîjust know it leans a bit sweet. Our friend went with the spaghetti and meatballs, which feels like Fratelli‚Äôs unofficial signature dish. Always classic, always comforting.\n\nTheir wine list leans Italian, of course, and it‚Äôs well-curated‚Äîplenty of great options by the glass or bottle. I only managed a couple photos this time because, full honesty‚Ä¶ I was way too excited to eat. Fratelli is a bit of a drive from home, and when you‚Äôre craving comforting Italian in a space that feels like family‚Äîyou make the trip.\n\nLooking for that mom-and-pop magic with consistently good food, generous portions, and a welcoming vibe? This is your spot.",

          "text": "Always Worth the Drive ‚Äî Comforting, Classic Italian with Heart\n\nFratelli Italian Food has been one of my go-to spots for years‚Äîand it never disappoints. Whether it‚Äôs date night, dinner with friends, or a bigger group outing, this place consistently delivers delicious food, warm service, and that homey, family-run charm that‚Äôs getting harder to find.\n\nI always recommend calling ahead for a reservation, especially if you‚Äôre rolling in with more than two people. They‚Äôve got plenty of room for larger groups (huge plus!), but I like the peace of mind knowing we‚Äôve got a table waiting.\n\nWe tend to start every meal the same way‚Äîwith their antipasto board, and honestly, why mess with perfection? It‚Äôs a beautiful spread of deli meats, cheeses, olives, sweet peppers, and this time, perfectly cooked asparagus. It‚Äôs shareable, satisfying, and the kind of appetizer that feels like an occasion in itself.\n\nEntrees come with a salad, and the house-made feta dressing is always our pick. Creamy, tangy, and addictive‚Äîit‚Äôs reason enough to clean your plate.\n\nFor my main dish, I went with the chicken piccata, and it was a win: tender, bright with lemon, and generously portioned. Between the caper-forward sauce and the size of the plate, it was a win for both my appetite and leftovers the next day. My other half ordered the veal marsala, which is rich and satisfying‚Äîjust know it leans a bit sweet. Our friend went with the spaghetti and meatballs, which feels like Fratelli‚Äôs unofficial signature dish. Always classic, always comforting.\n\nTheir wine list leans Italian, of course, and it‚Äôs well-curated‚Äîplenty of great options by the glass or bottle. I only managed a couple photos this time because, full honesty‚Ä¶ I was way too excited to eat. Fratelli is a bit of a drive from home, and when you‚Äôre craving comforting Italian in a space that feels like family‚Äîyou make the trip.\n\nLooking for that mom-and-pop magic with consistently good food, generous portions, and a welcoming vibe? This is your spot.",

We started with the calamari, which was well seasoned and breaded. I had the veal marsala with the daily soup. The daily soup was average. The veal marsala, however, was amazing. The sauce it comes with is delicious. My husband chose the clam linguini with the salad, which was good. The clam was quite tasty. For dessert, we had the chocobella cake, but unfortunately, it was also just average. I'm not sure if the chocolate cake is made in-house or bought from somewhere else, but for $10, I was expecting the cake to be better. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and know what to get again next time we visit and what to stay away from.",

          "text": "We like to try new places, especially to celebrate! Well last night at Fratelli‚Äôs was a disaster. We started in a great mood, was seated quickly, but there we waited. And waited. And waited. A cold apology was offered- but we ordered cocktails, appetizer and dinner all at once. The tables around us (seated after us) were seeing their wait staff, and had bread.\nWe were hungry too. I started looking around and another waitress (later learned was the manager) asked if we had bread. We said no, then our waitress brought bread a few mins later - again a heartless apology. But I figured- maybe she‚Äôs having a bad day. But as all the other tables seemed to be getting service, food, refills and attention- we more and more felt ignored. And hungry. And thirsty. Finally the hostess asked if we wanted more water and so we asked for our food to go, and our check.\nThen more than 10 minutes later (after our waitress helped other tables) she gave another empty apology and the manager was there and said it was her daughter. I‚Äôm okay with things being, busy or slow- but don‚Äôt ignore us. Check on us , let us know it‚Äôs going to be a bit. The other tables were well taken care of - not sure what we did or didn‚Äôt do. The appetizer was pretty good and one of the two soups were good. But nothing is worth being poorly treated when all you want is to go out for a nice night.",

          "text": "Me and my family came here to celebrate my father in law's birthday. At first we were skeptical as it wasn't super busy for a Saturday night but were pleasantly surprised.\n\nWe got 3 appetizers and they were all amazing. Fresh, light, and delicious. Then we got our entrees.\n\nChicken parm was delicious and perfectly cooked. Lasagna was cheesy but could use a bit more spicy. Spaghetti and meatballs was classic and tasty. Fettuccine Alfredo w/ shrimp was creamy, salty, and rich. Could use a bit more shrimp.\n\nHowever the carbanara was very disappointing. It lacked flavor, the sauce separated, and the panceta was overcook. It was upsetting seeing how everything else was wonderful.\n\nDessert was average. Tiramisu could use more lady fingers and less marscapone. The chocobella was rich but nothing special. And the vanilla gelato was creamy and the prefect amount of sweet.\n\nThe service was fantastic. Our server was attentive and friendly. Our waters were always full and drinks refilled without asking. We felt comfortable, taken care of, and enjoyed our evening.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a great place to come and enjoy some good Italian food.",

So I walk in at 8:35, 25 mins before they close and browse the menu. Now they are not to cheap of an option but well worth the cost but we'll get to that in a moment. So I ask the gentleman who was working what the serving size looked like and it wasn't as big as I had been hoping for but I settled on some Alfredo without any meat for $16 bucks. I jokingly told him to sneeze when he went to pour my pasta into the bowl so I'd get more, and said I would be back in about 5 mins to grab my order. I come back and this man makes my pasta HUGE no way that was a normal serving of pasta and slathered it's with Alfredo sauce, tells me he threw me in a piece of chicken for it being my first time trying the place and since they were about to close and he even hooked me up with 4 rolls. Now im sure most if not all that food would have ended up in the garbage since they were closing shortly however kudos to him for actually dishing it up to a customer. With  the cost of everything lately it should always be like this thank you brother, I just really hope I don't get you into trouble.",

On our last visit (on a Tuesday if it matters), we ordered chicken piccata and halibut piccata. The piccata sauce had a white wine/lemon flavor but was thick and somewhat gelatinous, like it had been thickened with cornstarch or perhaps had been delivered by Sysco. It was too much like gravy. The chicken breast itself was well-prepared and flavorful. The halibut was dry. Our server also had an unfortunate but forgivable off-night owing to the large number of tables she serviced.",

They were seasoned and cooked perfectly.\nI ordered the \"Veal Marsala\" and it was a tiny bit tough (that is the nature of the cut, of beef, I think) but, it was very good and the sauce was incredible!  My date ordered the Chicken Parmesan and LOVED it!  I tasted it and, I agreed!\nIt was so moist and delicious!  It melted in your mouth!  Cudo's to the Chef!!!!\nWe ordered Italian Sodas and they were THE WORST that we have ever had, ANYWHERE!   We both had a different flavor but, they tasted like carbonated water with a dash of food coloring (so weak, no flavor).  I have to believe that they were made the way that the Management tells them to them to be made(?)  Am I wrong???  For $3-$4 dollars (each) make them smaller but FULL of flavoring (like many of the other Italian eateree's that we frequent).\nOur waiter made us wait just a little to long (especially for the check).  We thought that he seemed preoccupied, but busy...a lot!  [You need to do better Carter, I still gave you a 15% tip.  It wasn't that busy, yet].  We arrived at 5:30 P.M. on a Saturday.  A customer should NEVER have to wait so long that they get up, walk across the restraunt and ask a different waitress for 'to go' boxes].  And, then have to (again) wait for a check.\nWe will definately eat here again, I think.\nThank You",

Only tried one entr√©e; 4 star on chicken alfredo. We needed to order the same thing for a small group and it was perfect for what was needed. The deserts were delicious. We tried several and split them up for sharing.  Everyone loved that.  By the way, consider them for home party take out - pricing reasonable.\n\nWe had chicken Alfredo, salad, dessert. I would like to try some other things on the menu. If I could have given 4.5 on the food, I would have.  The choice was 4 or 5 but not allowed to show in-between.  I WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK.
