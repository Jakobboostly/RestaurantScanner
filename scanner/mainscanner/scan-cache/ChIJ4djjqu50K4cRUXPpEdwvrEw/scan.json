Pizza was cooked perfect and very flavorful. Calzone was huge, soft, and delicious. The Arancini was so good and like nothing I‚Äôve had. The wine was fantastic and half off on Wednesday for the bottle. Our waiter Deangelo was the only server and bartender for the whole place and he did great. He was attentive, friendly, and very informative. I can‚Äôt wait to eat here again and try some of the other things on the menu.",

My husband got the Fig and Prosciutto Pizza (\"it was great, fantastic, amazing\"), and my 10y/o got the kids Spaghetti with Meatball (ate the whole thing and wanted seconds!)

Went up to the bar as no one brought the drinks we had ordered and his response was he would tell our server, he didn‚Äôt. Finally got to order our food and I asked again for my drink, still did not get it until someone else went and called him back. Food was good in the end but trying to get a drink was near impossible.",

          "text": "Pretty good for quality and prices. Definitely not a fancy place but the waitress was really kind. My wine pour was a bit stingy and definitely not a place for mixed drinks. My sister and I each got the caprese salad and I do think it was WAY too much cheese and olives for one person. We could have shared it easily, so in that sense I wasn't as happy with my salad since it got monotonous. But the mozzarella was a LOT tastier and fresher than most mozzarellas I've had outside of Napoli (and I lived in Napoli 4 years where mozzarella di bufala is from so I can be picky). I didn't try the diavola pizza but my fam liked it a lot. One of us got the chicken picata and he said the chicken wasn't great, but the pasta was good. Overall good experience for the price and to have relaxed non-fancy Italian food.",

          "text": "I love this pizzeria! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with friendly staff who make you feel welcomed. But the real star of the show is the pizza itself - the crust is perfectly crispy, the sauce is rich and tangy, and the cheese is melted to perfection.\n\nI've tried several different pies, but the Boss is my absolute favorite.\n\nPrices are super reasonable, especially considering the generous portion sizes. I've never left here feeling hungry or ripped off.\n\nOverall, I'm so impressed with this pizzeria. It's quickly become my go-to spot for a delicious, satisfying meal. Don't miss out - give it a try and taste the difference for yourself!",

I should have sent my salad back, that was my fault BUT I will not go back.",
