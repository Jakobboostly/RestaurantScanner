We ordered the Gyro with French fries, and it was hands down the best we‚Äôve had in the city,  the meat was perfectly seasoned, tender, and juicy, and the pita was fresh and soft. The fries were crispy and hot, making the combo unbeatable.\nThe value is incredible too, only $10 for a generous portion, which is rare to find these days. Service was outstanding: super friendly staff who were quick to prepare our order and made us feel welcome even though we ordered take‚Äëout.\nThey also have indoor seating available, so you can choose to dine in if you want to enjoy the atmosphere.\nWe loved it so much that we‚Äôre hoping they expand and open a location in Miami,  this kind of quality and price would be a hit there. If you‚Äôre in Naples and craving authentic Gyros with great service and value, don‚Äôt miss this spot.",

Lentil soup and pudding was excellent but I tried the chicken shish kebab and it was overcooked, had a rubber taste to it and I was unable to eat it. The waitress was nice and accommodating but it was not a nice feeling leaving the restaurant almost paying $85 and eating just the soup and pudding dessert after ordering two entrees along with them‚Ä¶ Partially my fault because I did not enjoy the lamb entree due to the smell of lamb meat in general but was I hoping I would enjoy the chicken more which I did not. Just a bad experience overall but the service and ambience was nice besides that.",

It's hard finding authentic turkish cuisine, but this place really hit the nail on the head. Tried a good amount of their dishes on the menu, and I can't recommend them enough! Each dish is better than the next.  If you are looking for quality and hearty meals, you have to visit Vourla.

          "text": "July 21, 2025 - As a party of four this time, we shared stuffed grape leaves and zucchini fritters for appetizers.  For entrees, the Grilled Vegetables were savory-flavorful; and the Oven-Baked Meatballs, while smaller than anticipated, were nonetheless excellent, filling, and presented bubbling in a cast-iron serving bowl.\n\nThe Moussaka was tasteful, but was served and flavored differently than the traditional [Greek] lasagna-like layered casserole. This Turkish version is better described as a stew served in a large shallow bowl.   See comparison photos.\n\nOur server, Murat, again provided exceptional service. When it started to rain as we leaving, another Vourla staffer was waiting at the door with an umbrella which he held for the ladies while getting into the car  Nice touch.  See first review below.\n===============================\nJuly 7, 2025 An easy review - FIVE stars. This evening was the first time the three of us had been to Vourla, and we'll definitely be back again. For appetizers, we shared Stuffed Grape Leaves, Char-Grilled Octopus, and Zucchini Fitters. All were spot-on. Our entrees were the Hand Chopped Adana Kebab, Grilled Vegetables, and Lamb Chops. Again, all were extremely satisfying, with the savory aromatic tastes characteristic of Turkish flavor profiles.

          "text": "July 21, 2025 - As a party of four this time, we shared stuffed grape leaves and zucchini fritters for appetizers.  For entrees, the Grilled Vegetables were savory-flavorful; and the Oven-Baked Meatballs, while smaller than anticipated, were nonetheless excellent, filling, and presented bubbling in a cast-iron serving bowl.\n\nThe Moussaka was tasteful, but was served and flavored differently than the traditional [Greek] lasagna-like layered casserole. This Turkish version is better described as a stew served in a large shallow bowl.   See comparison photos.\n\nOur server, Murat, again provided exceptional service. When it started to rain as we leaving, another Vourla staffer was waiting at the door with an umbrella which he held for the ladies while getting into the car  Nice touch.  See first review below.\n===============================\nJuly 7, 2025 An easy review - FIVE stars. This evening was the first time the three of us had been to Vourla, and we'll definitely be back again. For appetizers, we shared Stuffed Grape Leaves, Char-Grilled Octopus, and Zucchini Fitters. All were spot-on. Our entrees were the Hand Chopped Adana Kebab, Grilled Vegetables, and Lamb Chops. Again, all were extremely satisfying, with the savory aromatic tastes characteristic of Turkish flavor profiles. A special thanks to Murat, who graciously helped us decide on our selections and who served the attractive presentations and Chianti. We highly recommend Vourla for delicious Mediterranean cuisine.",

We ordered the Gyro with French fries, and it was hands down the best we‚Äôve had in the city,  the meat was perfectly seasoned, tender, and juicy, and the pita was fresh and soft. The fries were crispy and hot, making the combo unbeatable.\nThe value is incredible too, only $10 for a generous portion, which is rare to find these days. Service was outstanding: super friendly staff who were quick to prepare our order and made us feel welcome even though we ordered take‚Äëout.\nThey also have indoor seating available, so you can choose to dine in if you want to enjoy the atmosphere.\nWe loved it so much that we‚Äôre hoping they expand and open a location in Miami,  this kind of quality and price would be a hit there. If you‚Äôre in Naples and craving authentic Gyros with great service and value, don‚Äôt miss this spot.",

It's hard finding authentic turkish cuisine, but this place really hit the nail on the head. Tried a good amount of their dishes on the menu, and I can't recommend them enough! Each dish is better than the next.  If you are looking for quality and hearty meals, you have to visit Vourla. Top recommendations: turkish wedding soup, sultan's delight, Shepard's salad, and adana kebab.",

Lentil soup and pudding was excellent but I tried the chicken shish kebab and it was overcooked, had a rubber taste to it and I was unable to eat it. The waitress was nice and accommodating but it was not a nice feeling leaving the restaurant almost paying $85 and eating just the soup and pudding dessert after ordering two entrees along with them‚Ä¶ Partially my fault because I did not enjoy the lamb entree due to the smell of lamb meat in general but was I hoping I would enjoy the chicken more which I did not. Just a bad experience overall but the service and ambience was nice besides that.",
