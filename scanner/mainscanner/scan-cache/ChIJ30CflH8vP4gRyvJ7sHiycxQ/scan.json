DO BETTER MANAGEMENT!!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that the waitress ADMITTED to having her own fake ID (okay i guess?? Cool of this place to allow their employees to carry felonies with them) and tried to compare it to my legal state issued Michigan ID.\n\nDont get me wrong, the (insanely overpriced) food was great.

I even provided them my Military I.D. (issued by the government) and they still would not take it because they think its fake. DO BETTER MANAGEMENT!!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that the waitress ADMITTED to having her own fake ID (okay i guess?? Cool of this place to allow their employees to carry felonies with them) and tried to compare it to my legal state issued Michigan ID.\n\nDont get me wrong, the (insanely overpriced) food was great. If i could have tipped the cooks directly they deserve it, the general manager and waitress deserve a trip to the unemployment office.",

This may be a personal taste thing FWIW, but the wings have that fried non breaded greasy thing going similar to roosters but not as good. I'll give them that, i have certain taste for wings.\n\nBut the nachos are disgraceful. $11 for a plate of tortilla chips with cold meat, cold beans, cold cheese and sour cream. The pico was old or canned or something. It was a 4 dollar item if I'm being generous. A nit pick here, but fresh jalape√±os are the only way. Pickled jalape√±os are for barbecue and sandwiches.\n\nThe nachos really show the laziness. Nachos are a low cost, low labor item. It's all markup for the business. That's an opportunity. Blow me away with your nachos. The nachos absolutely kept me from ordering an entree. If you're going to do these I suggest doing some recon at other restaurants. Meat beans and chips should be hot and the corners toasty. Drizzle with hot cheese. Then pile on top some fresh pico, cilantro, lime wedges and salsa Verde. Dollop o daisy on top and bobs your uncle.\n\nAnother nit pick, learn how to pour Guinness.\n\nI harp on this because I want to help, I want to like iron city I love the legacy and nostalgia of the ol wingers building. But I feel like I get fleeced overtime I go.\n\nYou're running an eatery in a competitive market. I'm sitting at your table, you have my audience, just keep up your end of the bargain and keep me entertained! It's not hard.",

The loaded tots were very overcooked and did not taste well at all.  My drink was so watered down and inappropriately mixed that the overall taste left it undrinkable.  But the worse thing was the steak.   Upon recieving it the smell hit our entire table immediately.   Thinking it may have just been the onions my fianc√© cut into it and the rotten smell immediately made us all nauseas. The best thing about this meal was the ice water.  Will NOT be returning especially for the price!  If I could give a zero star rating I would!",

I can say there have been times when I have eaten in restaurant that I should have gone elsewhere because the meal took so long to come out we had to just take it to go and get in the car to not be late going somewhere. Generally giving yourself two hours at a restaurant to order food, eat, and leave should be ample time. Hopefully that has been resolved since we last experienced that.",

No wings had sauce and were mixed in the box. Neither were hot. Neither had much flavor. The girl on the phone was super slow and when I picked up my order she obviously didn't care. She also asked me if I wanted celery but they didn't give it to me. I am local but they are 2 for messing up my orders. Don't know how they stay in business.",

I felt like she was rushing us when she came back w our check. The food was good- I had the Iron City Burger w fries & my hubs had boneless wings. Hubs said his wings (spicy garlic, I think) were good, taste of chicken was good on but he said it could be more spicy. My burger was tasty but fries were a little too salty. The burger was really yummy BUT when we got home.... I rushed to the bathroom getting sick-doesn't taste good coming back up!!! So, I don't think we will be going back for a while!!",

DO BETTER MANAGEMENT!!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that the waitress ADMITTED to having her own fake ID (okay i guess?? Cool of this place to allow their employees to carry felonies with them) and tried to compare it to my legal state issued Michigan ID.\n\nDont get me wrong, the (insanely overpriced) food was great. If i could have tipped the cooks directly they deserve it, the general manager and waitress deserve a trip to the unemployment office.",
