          "text": "Honestly, it was fast food pizza. Nothing going to change your life here, but a fun place to try. The pizza doesn‚Äôt look that appetizing (some better lighting might go a long way), but it tasted great after it was heated up.\n\nThe decor sort of tries to be hip on one wall and the seating is good there. The other 90% of the place feels like a converted 7/11 and kind of haphazardly put together as an afterthought.\n\nI‚Äôve been here several times. They changed the lunch special, so the included drink is limited to a much smaller selection of canned drinks, but still a decent deal for a slice, drink, and a couple garlic knots.",

The good thing is that a slice of pizza is inexpensive at only 3.50. maybe it was just the slice that I got, but Iight try it again due to the prices",

I prefer more savory but over all great. Employees were very friendly.  Atmosphere..i really liked the wall art. I wish there was more lower tables..im short and its hard to get up on the high stools. But over all great place.",

          "text": "This is my favorite Pizza place in Utah County! I try to go at least once a week to get their lunch special. The staff are very friendly and are able to give me their recommendations when I am not sure what to order. I have tried most of their styles and have not been disappointed yet. The restaurant is decorated with black & white murals depicting different areas of New York and are complemented by the swing music that is usually playing on their sound system. Whenever I eat here I feel like I am in an over-the-top caricature of New York and it definitely helps break up the monotony of the work day.\n\nIf you make a large order, or order for several people make sure to double check that the order is correct before you leave. On two occasions they have forgotten to put the garlic knots in my lunch special when multiple people are ordering. Despite this I plan on continuing to stop by weekly. Highly recommended!",

          "text": "Really hit the spot. I've got about zero experience with NY pizza but the slice, but hey, it was great pizza and ranch and garlic knots. I'd totally go again, even when I'm a county away. The interior is spacious and clean, a bathroom at the back, lots of standing room, then chairs around, four tables inside and two picnic bench tables outside. Pizzas are readymade and in view so you can browse and choose what you want. I got two meal deals‚Äîeach with a slice, two knots, and a drink‚Äîfor about $12, so that's good spending. You just walk in, order and pay at the counter, then wait for your order and go. I really like the small sliced pepperoni on pizza, so I was glad to see it used here, and it was great. For their big pies they have a nice melty cheese, and for the pie with pecorino (mmm), the cheesiness has a great chew to it to go with the thicker crust on that one. Definitely recommend that one. Drink variety is pretty great! Ranch and red sauce for dipping are great. The red sauce cup is the same sauce they use on their pizza. It's kinda sweet and it's chunky not smooth; I liked it a lot. The worker said they have gluten free options. Signage also showed a breakfast item, and it looked really yummy. Breakfast 6-11. The worker was very nice, very professional and changed gloves between services rendered, gave me an extra slice when the first one stuck to the oven and came out torn, so it was just a great first experience for sure, and I'd absolutely recommend giving it a try and give their business your patronage! Leftovers reheated really well with that hot pan and ice cube hack (lookit up), so buying a whole pie (they seemed super well priced for their size) won't go to waste if any lasts for leftovers! Parking lot is relatively small, but spacious so getting in and out isn't a problem. Yep, give it a go!",

I truly wish you the best.\n\nI really want this place to succeed and do well.  I bought slices here on two different occasions about a week apart.  Both times slices had too much flour on the bottom but were cooked well otherwise.\n\nPizza did not have a lot of flavor however which is my main concern.  Sauce needed more punch.\n\nIMO Nico's(Provo) and Lucys(Orem) reign supreme if you are a NY style pizza lover, both comparably priced as well.\n\nThis is not NY style pizza that I am accustomed to living in NY and NJ.  It is too doughy and too much flour on the undercarriage.",

But the sauce ruined it.\n\nService was mid, slices took a little long. But I assume 2 slices, max 5 mins not 10. Everyone seemed bored. But that might just be the area or city service workers. At 7.25 min wage, I might be the same\n\nAtmosphere was fine, lunch time, so it had some foot traffic. But some music would help",
