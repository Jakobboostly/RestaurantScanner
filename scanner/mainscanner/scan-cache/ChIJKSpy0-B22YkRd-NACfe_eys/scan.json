She asked about the slicing and I chose the standard 8 slice versus the square 16 sliced. Pizza came out 16 sliced and the crust edges and bottom were hard and crunchy. You couldn't even cut it with the knife they gave you. Horrible pizza. Had a similar issue 2 years ago also. Burned black crust. Wouldn't fix or do anything about it. Time before was in 2012 and back then their pizza was the best. Not now. I'll go elsewhere. Especially at that price.",

I appreciate the old being incorporated into the new, every detail from the train running across the ceiling to the original tables with old sports clippings and the Pepsi cola light fixtures, up to the hole in the ceiling where they can toss the pizzas. Only problem is:\nno one tossed the pizzas.\nThe open kitchen concept I would believe is for the customers to watch them toss the pizzas and unfortunately they did not. Kind of defeated the purpose of Pepi‚Äôs original love of pizza tossing. It‚Äôs a lost art. I would love to see that here again; it‚Äôs what made Pepi‚Äôs pizza so memorable for us kids in the old days. I do love the new building and all they have done to keep Pepi‚Äôs restaurant charm alive but that hand tossing would really be a wonderful thing to see again!",
