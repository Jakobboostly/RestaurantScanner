I would have enjoyed Costco more. My friends ordered a supreme pizza that was not cooked in the middle.",

The person taking the order didn't seem too happy to be there and appeared frustrated with us as we tried to figure out what to order. It was also pretty expensive for two of their smallest pizzas, a salad, and a side for 60 dollars is a bit. Google search showed here as a place for fire roasted pizza, but I don't think that was correct. I would probably take friends here for the vibe and artwork.",

It's NOT \"Just Another Pizza.\" The wood fired pizza was a light and crispy crust that was fluffy and soft inside.\n\nThe crust had a traditionally slightly salty flavor, but just the right hint of sweetness to it. It was a slice above. Lol get it slice above, pizza, haha.\n\nThe sauce. Great flavor, with balanced seasoning. No one seasoning over powered the other. Great fresh tomato flavor, with just the right size of tomato chunks in it.\n\nToppings...\nWe'll we did a half and half.\nOne side was a combo and the other was Lasagna.\n\nI went for lasagna first and it was amazing.\nI was feeling like combo is sometimes a bunch of under or over cooked veggies and, well not really my thing. How about WOW! I have never had a combo I felt it was to die for! Ok that might be a little extreme, but man oh man, it was delicious. The veggies were well balanced and cooked just right. Fresh? Yes, very!\n\nBoth sides had sausage. It wasn't the typical sausage, it was sliced fresh Italian sausage. We'll done Este Pizza.\n\nAtmosphere -\nReal cool vibe in this place. You can see the cool decals all over the partition and graffiti walls. Real cool art, and I'm not a graffiti buff. Open ceilings. Great music! Cool rock and roll 70's - Today. Heard some Stones, Halen, Sublime...\n\nWe came at an odd hour (pretty early for pizza). Really brunch for the 4 of us, they were just getting going.\n\nAs always, that was my/our experience! I can't implore you enough to give it a shot and post your own review!",

          "text": "It was a cold and windy afternoon‚Ä¶ and pizza sounded like the antidote. Where to as we made our way south? Este Pizza of course!\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt my first, nor will it be my last visit to this casual Sugarhouse eatery. Is it the 90‚Äôs rock music, the tacky stickers all over the booths, or the broken candy machine at the exit that keep me coming back? No, it‚Äôs the orzo salad! :) Not that the pizzas are bad. Our veggie lasagna pizza was fantastic. Fresh ingredients, chewy but not too thick crust, and just the right amount of everything made it a new go-to. The small is not small at all and provides 8 large slices. We couldn‚Äôt finish it, but will enjoy the leftovers.\n\nThis is an order at the counter and they bring it to you kind of place. But, the woman who greeted us, took our order, brought out our food, and provided our to-go box was pleasant, helpful and kind. She deserves a raise and helps temper the skater/snowboarder indifferent vibe.\n\nBut, back to the orzo salad with its bed of spinach, warm and flavorful orzo filled with toasted pine nuts, and the fresh ricotta cheese. It is the best thing on the menu! I literally dream about this salad. I think it may have shrunk in size (or my desire for more has increased). It‚Äôs enough to share with a friend, but you may wish to didn‚Äôt have to. I do have to say that it is best eating in, so that the orzo is still warm. Mmmm. I want more now!",

The pizza sauce is very oniony and slops off of the pizza when you try to eat it. The service was fine, you have to walk up to order. My friend ordered a seltzer and she said it was flat. I would have enjoyed Costco more. My friends ordered a supreme pizza that was not cooked in the middle.",
