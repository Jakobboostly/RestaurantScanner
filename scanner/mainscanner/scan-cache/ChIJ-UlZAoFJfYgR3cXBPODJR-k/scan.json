          "text": "The chicken alfredo was beyond spicy ü•µ i had to send it back. My childs mac and cheese was spicy as well. Service was below par. My son had a calzone and for a little bit of dipping marinara we were charged $1.25 for it. A guy who looked like he rolled out of bed literally was walking in and out of the kitchen and was with his friend who was walking around the restaurant with a cigarette that was put out but smelled terrible.  He was also dressed in pajamas. The bathrooms were gross as well. I only gave it a 2 star because my other son liked his buffalo chicken pizza. This is the second time there and the food just isnt worth it.",

Our group decided to give it a try, and we were truly impressed. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with exceptional hospitality and service. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and polite, making sure our orders were taken promptly and accurately.\n\nThe food was outstanding, far surpassing our expectations for a strip mall location. Our glasses were always full, and the server checked on us regularly. Although my wife‚Äôs chicken parmesan was slightly overdone, the server quickly resolved the issue to our satisfaction.\n\nThe gangster-themed atmosphere was a bit quirky but added a unique charm. Our friends from Alabama enjoyed it as well and mentioned they would bring other friends for future visits. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and would definitely return. We truly appreciate the excellent service and delicious food.",
