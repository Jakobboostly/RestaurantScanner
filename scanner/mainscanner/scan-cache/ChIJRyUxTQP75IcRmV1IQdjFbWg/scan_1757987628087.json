Be careful ordering extra bacon as the normal amount is already a lot.  We like bacon a lot and extra bacon was too much.  So good, though!\n\n- Original Bacon: The original crust was a little on the thinner side, almost too thin.\n\n- Gluten-Free Pepperoni: My wife and daughter shared a gluten-free pepperoni pizza and both thoroughly enjoyed it!  They are both not super sensitive to gluten, though.  If you are really sensitive, this place will not work for you.\n\nWe had the pizzas on Friday at 5pm.",

Came back to visit in 1979. DELICIOUS. 44 years later, now it's delivery or carry out. But still hoping for that DELICIOUS pizza. :.(\n\nI bought a large cb and s pizza. I knew I would have a slice in the car on the way to take it to people I visited last in 2019. You know how you take a slice and it is super hot so you quickly get it out of the box and put it down? This pizza was barely warm. Part of the crust was burnt (2 slices). The tips(?) Of the sauerkraut were burnt (black). I never had that before! It was dry. All we could figure out was maybe they had made it for earlier in the day and kept it in a warmer(right at the counter). It was bad, even if it was just plain cheese. So sad. I waited 44 years to have that pizza again. If this is how that pizza is made now, sad. The guy that waited on me was in his 50s I think. Silly me, I thought he might be the manager, so I will definitely get a great pizza. Sad. Sad Sad.",

Our daughter had an emergency at school and we had to drive back across town leaving our pizza sit there for 45 minutes. Called the store to ask them if our pizza was still there and hadn't been tossed but that we would still be on our way to pick it up. On arrival at 1150ish we went in to grab the pizza and they told us that it was almost done. I was confused because I didn't ask for a new one, it was my fault anyway. The general manager Teagan had already taken the initiative and made us a new pizza because she didn't want us to eat and old looking one. She went above and beyond to make our experience good even though it was our fault and not theirs!!!!! I will forever go to this location from now on.",

This Happy Joes Pizza taco pizza is full of meat, cheese, lettuce and more.  They give you packets of flavorful taco sauces too.  Note on Mondays and Tuesdays, they are much cheaper (less than $19) ... a real bargain!",

The problem lied in that the pizzas had clearly been in the delivery vehicle for most of that time frame. The pizzas were inedible by the time they arrived.  The delivery driver was very pleasant, which was the only bright spot.  $55 for 2 pizzas that we couldn't eat isn't ideal.",
