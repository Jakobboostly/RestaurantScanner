Tots were pretty good, and got a free Oreo shake when I signed up for texts.

Then my friends that did an online order both had to wait over an hour for their food. Upon asking them multiple times where their food was, the staff said they were still working on it. After an hour and a half, they got one of the orders out and it was completely wrong. However we just still ate it because we didn‚Äôt want to wait for a new burger. My other friend asked for his food many more times, and they brought him the wrong food not once but twice. He asked for a refund and they said they don‚Äôt know how to give one. So after 4 wrong orders, I was not happy. Very disappointed in my experience here. I wanted to enjoy it but I don‚Äôt know if I will ever be back.",

We only noticed because the bag was way too small. Our receipt had been attached to the incorrect order.\n- The burger for my two-year-old had an extra patty.\n- One burger was supposed be plain but had everything on it.\n- The chili cheese fries weren't great. The \"chili\" on them mostly tasted like tomato, and didn't have much meat or seasoning.\n- The onion ring side wasn't as large as we expected for >$5.",

The woman at the counter was dismissive and unhelpful. Despite only four people in the lobby, it took 45 minutes to get my food. When it finally arrived, several items were missing. I pointed this out, but she insisted everything was in the bag and refused to believe me until I unpacked it in front of her. Even then, she argued I hadn‚Äôt ordered the missing items‚Äîuntil I showed her my receipt. Reluctantly, she took another 15 minutes to bring the items. To top it off, I was still missing four of the six dipping sauces I ordered, and she called me ‚Äúneedy‚Äù when I asked for them. I will never return and wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone.",

The food came out hot and fresh, and you can really tell everything is made to order.\n\nThe burgers are absolutely delicious‚Äîjuicy, perfectly seasoned, and packed with flavor. I love that they give you so many options to customize, from classic cheeseburgers to unique specialty creations. The buns were soft and fresh, and the toppings tasted really high-quality. I also ordered fries and a milkshake, and both were fantastic. The fries were golden and crispy, not greasy at all, and the milkshake was thick, creamy, and easily one of the best I‚Äôve had.\n\nWhat stood out the most was how quick the service was without ever feeling rushed. The employees made sure everything was just right, and they even checked in to make sure I was happy with my meal. It really shows that they care about their customers.\n\nOverall, Wayback Burgers delivers exactly what you‚Äôd hope for in a burger joint‚Äîgreat food, excellent service, and a relaxed atmosphere. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back and recommending it to friends and family!",

After waiting over an hour and asking about my food twice, they finally brought me an order‚Äîonly for it to be a lettuce wrap instead of my Cajun burger.\n\nI took it back and asked for a refund, but the staff told me they didn‚Äôt know how to process one and promised to bring out the correct meal. Twenty minutes later, they gave me a Bourbon Burger instead. At this point, after nearly two hours of waiting, I just wanted my money back. Instead of a full refund, I was only given $10 for my $15 order.\n\nReally disappointing experience. I won‚Äôt be coming back to this location.",

Then my friends that did an online order both had to wait over an hour for their food. Upon asking them multiple times where their food was, the staff said they were still working on it. After an hour and a half, they got one of the orders out and it was completely wrong. However we just still ate it because we didn‚Äôt want to wait for a new burger. My other friend asked for his food many more times, and they brought him the wrong food not once but twice. He asked for a refund and they said they don‚Äôt know how to give one. So after 4 wrong orders, I was not happy. Very disappointed in my experience here. I wanted to enjoy it but I don‚Äôt know if I will ever be back.",

Shift lead proceeded to \"make\" our food for 15 more minutes while we waited for our money back. These were made fresh and you can see by the picture the double cheese bacon burger bowl had about a half a hamburger on it and no bacon. Then we get food and 2 out of the 3 things are wrong.

The counter server who answered my ridiculous questions with saint-like patience and actually brought food to our table like some fast-food fairy godmother. In a world of ‚Äúorder 47, come get your sad meal,‚Äù this was refreshingly human.\nMy brilliant deconstructed burger experiment was‚Ä¶ fine. You know, ‚Äúfine‚Äù like your cousin‚Äôs potato salad ‚Äì edible but missing the magic. Turns out there‚Äôs a reason burgers come pre-assembled. Next time I‚Äôm trusting the engineers and ordering like a normal person.\nBut the chocolate brownie shake? Pure liquid regret. Despite reading warnings that it was sweeter than a rom-com and runnier than my gym excuses, I ordered it anyway. This shake was so thin I spent more time stirring than drinking, and sweet enough to cause diabetes through osmosis. Should‚Äôve gotten a soda and saved myself the disappointment.\nThe Verdict: Great service, decent burgers (if you don‚Äôt try to reinvent them), and shakes that are basically chocolate-flavored mistakes. Skip the liquid stuff, stick to the solids, and tip that counter angel and you may get the extra effort you paid for!",
