As far as the pizza slices I purchased, the crust was so thick and the layer of cheese and sauce was so thin it just added to my sadness lol but so serious. It was like eating straight bread it was so thick. If there was more sauce and cheese it may have been better but the fact my kid didn‚Äôt eat it and she‚Äôs 8 & completely obsessed with pizza says it all. I took 1 bite and just threw it in a bag.

It was like eating straight bread it was so thick. If there was more sauce and cheese it may have been better but the fact my kid didn‚Äôt eat it and she‚Äôs 8 & completely obsessed with pizza says it all. I took 1 bite and just threw it in a bag.
