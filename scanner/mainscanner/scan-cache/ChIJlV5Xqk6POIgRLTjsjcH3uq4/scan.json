The photos made me excited to try this restaurant, hoping for a slightly crispy crust similar to what you get from a brick oven pizza. Nope! It‚Äôs so limp that I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a slice without it falling down and toppings spilling off. I also was put off by some of the toppings, especially the chicken chunks which were **dark** meat pieces that even had some pieces of cartilage mixed in! Are they using the chicken pizzas as a way to not waste unwanted chicken?? Overall a disappointing experience, sadly.",

I ordered the dragon and both my eyes and tastebuds were pleased.Server had a spill on the table but was very polite and considerate. Overall a great spot that also has parking nearby.",

Cheese was tough, thick, and congealed. All together, the pizza had no flavor. For a $30 pizza, I was incredibly disappointed. My husband and I ate two slices of a 16inch pizza and ended up throwing the whole thing away. Save your money and go literally anywhere else",

          "text": "Okay, they genuinely earned this good review. Hard.\n\nI ordered a door dash. About 50 minutes later, a dasher arrives with the wrong order. I didn't notice right away because there was a pizza and a large garlic... something that I thought was mine. 30 seconds later, I realized it was wrong and called Door Dash who wanted to do very little. Door Dash doesn't have a big office with folks taking phone calls, so I was PISSED. Called this location to complain and was STILL pissed.\n\nThrew everything in the car which is what I was trying to avoid since it was late in the day, and drove over to the Rich St one (the one I ordered from over at the Trolly closed for the day while it was being delivered). A manager came up and I started yelling. Hell, I would've started throwing napkins and straws and whatnot. But I encountered a decent manager that did everything he could to calm me down. I did because it was nice to have a person talking to me rationally after a long day.\n\nHe asks what my order was, lets me know he'll get it all taken care of. He did!\n\nAs for the food? FABULOUS. Large pizza, pie style cut with a thin crust (neapolitan style), well cooked, and a garlic bread. All of it quite worthy. I should go here more often, and given their attitudes and incredibly professional demeanor while looking quite casual is the type of local shop that deserves infinite respect!!\n\nSorry for giving anyone here a bad experience, and thank you endlessly for handling the Door Dash mistake with utmost respect and care. This is a business that is ready to do business. If it ain't right, they will strive to make it right! Classy, and damn good pizza.",

That‚Äôs a whole other ball game üò©. Additionally, the cheese was runny & wouldn‚Äôt stay on at all. And lastly, there was a bit too much sauce in opinion.\n\nI wanted to go back & ask for a remake, but it would‚Äôve been at least a one and a half hour wait & I just didn‚Äôt have that in me. I went back to ask for a refund, but there wasn‚Äôt anyone available - the manager/ownerr(?) was double duty working in the back in the kitchen & trying to serve the patrons who were there, the dining room was rough, they were slammed.\n\nI‚Äôm bummed about today because I was really looking forward for my pizza :(",

          "text": "I got The Dragon pizza and a Caesar salad. The Caesar dressing tasted HEAVILY of nutritional yeast, and it overwhelmed the other flavors. I actually really like the flavor of nutritional yeast, and put it on lots of things at home, but whatever was going on with this dressing made it not taste like Caesar at all, and it was off-putting. The large shavings of Parmesan in the salad were rubbery and unpleasant to chew. The croutons were great.\n\nThe pros of the pizza: it had one million pepperonis, which is awesome, and the edge crust was crispy and delicious. The cons: the pepperoni layer was directly on the (veryyyyyyyy limp, soggy, and floppy) crust, and when I lifted it, the entire layer of toppings peeled away and fell forward from the crust edge and fell entirely off the pizza in one sheet. The cheese is on top of the pepperoni, with none underneath. I‚Äôve never had that happen with a pizza. After I put the sheet of toppings back on and tried again carefully, it did it again but this time it all ended up sliding off onto the floor before I could catch it. This happened with all the pieces I tried to eat. I eventually gave up.\nThe pepperonis, while wonderfully abundant on the pizza, had a sharp burnt plastic flavor that was really unappealing, and the majority of the crust was soggy and had a slimy texture where the toppings met the crust.\n\nMy food was $35, so I was super disappointed. I won‚Äôt be going back even though it‚Äôs right by where I live. I absolutely wasted my money.",

          "text": "The place is OKAY and pizzas are hit or miss. I like that they offer vegan options, but there are some they shouldn't offer at all. For example they had a loaded potato option which was terrible and for whatever reason they couldn't add bacon bits (literally vegan) and there wasn't anything to replace the sour cream (like oh idk vegan sour cream.) it was literally just a flat piece of bread with mozzarella and fake sausage crumbles. I could of made it in my toaster and had it cost less than $30. My coworkers like it but I'll probably be talking them out of ordering this for our work events from now on. The guy who delivered also dropped all of the garlic knots on the ground, but I'm guessing that's through a 3rd party.",

          "text": "In respond to the newest comment. Faith, I don‚Äôt appreciate you being rude talking about ‚Äú maybe next time ask for a manager, instead of  Shouting your misperceptions into the void‚Äù\n1 nobody is shouting into the void, 2 we did speak to the manager, and 3 you need to makes sure your employees keep up with good Hygiene. Everyone is responsible to keep themselves clean, but I feel like it‚Äôs not a huge ask for someone to wash their hands after they came back in from a smoke break. It‚Äôs common sense.\nI watched her for 10 mins, maybe even a little longer. She came in from her smoke break, walked through the bar to put her coat away, and right after she proceeded to pick up dirty dishes, she walked it to the POS in the bar and sat them down. She walked directly to the food in the window and delivered cheese bread to the booth in the corner of the restaurant. After that, she went back to the food in the window, grab the garlic knots and deliver them to our table. Between all of that, she did not end up, washing her hands until after we mentioned it, And to top it all off She stated that she forgot to wash her hands and that she will have the garlic knots remade. After she told the manger( which is a cook currently in the kitchen ) she then washed her hands. And yes I saw her wash her hands after the fact. No need for us to lie. But you definitely just lied and received an attitude on the performance of your employees. You weren‚Äôt in the store today and you wasn‚Äôt present during the whole transaction we had at yellow brick. You received a phone call about the review that was posted. It‚Äôs he said, she said, you don‚Äôt have all the facts. üòÇ\nI just don‚Äôt appreciate the comment made towards my mother. When you were in the wrong.",

Yes, I did stay because I asked for the garlic knots to be remade. She did not wash her hands until I asked her about it because I was sitting right by the kitchen where I could see the food I could see her go in and out, and I watched her go smoke, come in hang up her coat and go directly to the garlic knots so she did not wash her hands at the bar until she spoke with you and told you about remaking the garlic knots because she forgot to wash her hands. After she spoke to you, she washed her hands at the bar. We were sitting at the first table and we could see in the kitchen so that is how I know she didn‚Äôt wash her hands. There was no reason for you to be rude and say that I‚Äôm still here dining. Of course I‚Äôm still here because you remade my garlic knots. By the way, thank you for sending the guy to tell us  we did not have to pay for our food that was nice, but I don‚Äôt appreciate you going on here as if I‚Äôm lying. I could see her when she walked in and hung up her coat and she went straight to the food. I have no reason to lie. As you stated, we are regular customers and you‚Äôve seen us several times before. You are a rude owner!!!! Just because I am African American doesn‚Äôt mean I am lying.  I am a regular at your restaurant.  You have a sign about what you don‚Äôt tolerate (bullying of the pride flag and rude people), but you are being a bully and discriminatory.\n\nThis is exactly what happened and there is another witness. You should have apologized instead of being nasty. Support ALL PEOPLE, not some people.  I have business meetings at your restaurant, and refer people to your restaurant. If you don‚Äôt think black people are honest‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs very sad. I don‚Äôt post misconceptions. I post accurate information.  I spoke with the gentleman behind the bar before I posted the review.\n\nAs I stated, in my accurate review‚Ä¶.\nI just sat here and watch a server go outside and smoke and come back in and pick up pizza and garlic knots and serve them. I also watched her go to the kitchen and tell the baker what I said as if it was something wrong with what I said. If you‚Äôre touching door knobs, you should never go in touch food because your fingers are right on the edge of the plate.",

            "text": "Thier garlic cheese knots were üî•!! On point with those, delicious!! Thier deep dish Chicago pizza was, uh, yuk!! Took 40 min, was cold, cheese was rubber, and way to much sauce. The staff was amazing.  A+ to staff, great job. I advise if you want to visit, get the garlic cheese knots. Besides that, hard pass. Again great staff. LGBTQ+ friendly. A good plus. Walls were dirty, needs cleaned. Floors need better clean care. But the staff again WAS AMAZING!!",
