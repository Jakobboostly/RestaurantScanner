The space is small and service was almost non-existent which was surprising given how small it is. We had to reach out for basic things. When we did speak with someone they were nice and helpful.\n\nI don‚Äôt recommend getting the charred octopus. For $22 we got ONE small tentacle on top of lentils. Vastly overpriced and flavor did not make up for it",

They clearly are a family from the counties in which the food is served and the food is authentic. If stopping in, they have a selection of dishes for two people that allows you to choose, and it is delicious! The skewers, the eggplant, the hummus, the tabbouleh was fantastic. The atmosphere was a little lacking but it's ok because it felt like a family-oreiented place, and the service mirrored that. I felt special just eating there. I am looking forward to coming again. If you crave Middle Eastern Arabic/Greek food, you need to go there. It is worth the time!",

The flavors are out of this world, hard to find such rich and flavorful food but this place hit it out of the ballpark. Our server, Ani(sorry if mispelled) was the sweetest and most accommodating ever. It was a birthday dinner and she did not miss a beat, she made it so special and she was so personable and fun to talk to. Our water was always full, the bussers always kept the table clean of plates that we finished eating from. As someone in the restaurant industry this was such a wholesome experience. Recommend this cute little place to everyone was such a great find!",

The lentils were full of flavor, the dish was so well-balanced and satisfying.  The ambiance is warm and inviting ‚Äî a perfect setting for a relaxed dinner or special occasion. We came from NYC to celebrate a birthday and it ended up being such a special night. We loved the modern Armenian music and art that decorated the restaurant.

Unfortunately when I went for a medium meal the waitress kept trying to encourage us to order more, and when it was clear we were fine with our 4 tapas plates for two people, rushed us out as quickly as she could. It was at the point where she was taking our silverware after we told her we were still working on our food, haha. I think we spent under an hour there and we had a reservation, so it's not like they'd squeezed us in. Really disappointing after my previous great experiences with service.",

When we did speak with someone they were nice and helpful.\n\nI don‚Äôt recommend getting the charred octopus. For $22 we got ONE small tentacle on top of lentils. Vastly overpriced and flavor did not make up for it",

A influencer posted for Northern Liberties restaurant week highlighting this place, and from what I saw, I had to have it. I've been doing restaurant weeks in the city and on the outskirts for many many years now. I have never had an experience where I've received so much delicious food for my money ($45). I came here with two other friends for the first week of Northern Liberties restaurant week. With my first experience, just off of the taste and the amount of food that I got I knew I had to come back before restaurant week was over. I made my second visit on the Saturday of the last day of restaurant week. My friend and I dined in for my second time and had an extraordinary experience. We got the abundance of food for just $45, accompanied by the generosity of the owner, who opened the bottle of his own tequila and poured shots from it for free. He was very interactive, and very personable. Anytime an owner is that involved and nice to their customers, they get me. He asked me my name, and addressed me every single time afterwards by it. And because of the simple gesture, and the delicious food... They've got a customer that will keep coming back. I will support this business as long as it's around. The staff is very nice & the space is very quaint.",

I left a note in our reservation about our special night, and they brought our dessert out with a candle in it! And all of the staff wished us a Happy Anniversary on our way out. It‚Äôs the little things.\n\nThe food was also amazing. I‚Äôm actually eating my leftovers right now and it‚Äôs still really good.",

They clearly are a family from the counties in which the food is served and the food is authentic. If stopping in, they have a selection of dishes for two people that allows you to choose, and it is delicious! The skewers, the eggplant, the hummus, the tabbouleh was fantastic. The atmosphere was a little lacking but it's ok because it felt like a family-oreiented place, and the service mirrored that. I felt special just eating there. I am looking forward to coming again. If you crave Middle Eastern Arabic/Greek food, you need to go there. It is worth the time!",
