The seating situation is a bit cramped; we came on a snowy morning, but it was still busy. We had to sit at a larger table with another group at the other end. Not terrible, but be aware.

They do counter service but if you get a drink, you have to get up and go to the counter and wait for someone else to refill it. Lastly, their kitchen isn't very well ventilated. It was slightly smoky out in the dining area due to cooking in the back, and that wasn't great. It's an okay spot for breakfast but there are better options at the same price point.",

Honestly I just love being able to go to a restaurant and not have to ask a million questions about the menu and what is or isn‚Äôt GF. And for being allergy friendly I am very pleased with the prices! I have paid way more for way less at other places.

          "text": "My wife and daughter have celiac and my son has a dairy allergy so needless to say finding anywhere that serves breakfast that caters to this is very challenging. I have no allergy issues so even with the places that do have options for them I rarely enjoy the food. Locals is not only the exception, I prefer their food over non allergy friendly places. The food was spectacular. The breakfast tacos are the best I have ever had at any eatery. The bananas foster pancakes were exceptional. To add to this they make an excellent latte. Completely blown away. I never write reviews but the food was so fantastic I want to do anything I can to encourage business (because selfishly I want one to open closer to where we live so I can frequent their business lol). Go here, celiac or not. You will not be disappointed. In the mean time I‚Äôll be dreaming about the breakfast tacos until I make the 40 minutes drive again.",

Allergies of them were delicious, the waffles and the bagel sandwich were standouts. The sweet roll was good, but a bit more grainy and crumbly than a gluten cinnamon roll. The seating situation is a bit cramped; we came on a snowy morning, but it was still busy. We had to sit at a larger table with another group at the other end. Not terrible, but be aware. It is just a small restaurant. Neither of us have gluten allergies, but have relatives who are, and we will definitely be taking them here when they come to visit!",

          "text": "I really wanted to like this place but they unfortunately fell short. I ordered the fried banana bread sticks because lots of other reviews have raved about it. Mine was completely burnt--like, completely blackened and I could only cut off maybe 1/3 of each piece to eat. I had to use a fork and knife to cut through and it took work. I think the idea is great but execution was poor. Also it was served on way too small of a plate--syrup was falling off all over the place. My husband ordered pancakes and they were burnt on one side as well, and his bacon was underdone. We asked for our money back because it truly wasn't edible and they were nice about it.\n\nThey were busy, but for me that should never be an excuse for poor food service. The mark of a good versus a great place is one that can produce the same quality regardless of how many people are there.\n\nA smaller comment, but the seating is awkward. They have mainly large tables, so you ended up sharing with at least one other group at your table. It would have been better with a bunch of small tables.",

          "text": "We drove out here from Hooper to try out this gluten-free restaurant. We got a bunch of different options. We tried the cinnamon roll, the small pancakes with eggs and bacon, the hot honey chicken and waffles, the lemon pound cake waffle and the bagel sandwich. The cinnamon roll was huge and delicious, we took it home to-go. The winner was the chicken and waffles, my husband was in heaven and I was jealous that I didn't get it for myself. I got the bagel sandwich and was a bit disappointed. It was cold, dry and not what I thought it would be... not enough sauce and moisture and the bagel wasn't toasted. The lemon waffles and pancakes were all fantastic though. There was a huge group there that took all of the chairs and tables when we went so we didn't get a good idea of what the seating is like. Everyone else was squishing together on the benches. The food was worth it though so I'll give them 5 stars for keeping up with the craziness going on that day. My only real complaint was the cold bagel sandwich that came out last after everything else. Definitely get the chicken and waffles or any of the sweet options, they are bomb!",

We shared a Green Smoothie. I don‚Äôt remember ever having a better breakfast sandwich. Excellent flavors, great portions for the price. Very nice atmosphere. Menu is very easy to understand and choose from. For the first time ever I now understand the difference between a latte, cappuccino, and americano thanks to their drink menu.üòä We love this place immediately and plan to come back at least monthly to try everything on the menu.

They do counter service but if you get a drink, you have to get up and go to the counter and wait for someone else to refill it. Lastly, their kitchen isn't very well ventilated. It was slightly smoky out in the dining area due to cooking in the back, and that wasn't great. It's an okay spot for breakfast but there are better options at the same price point.",

They charge two dollars for a sacrament cub size of avocado and burnt everything. They got our food wrong twice and we don‚Äôt like to be picky but they burnt everything. I‚Äôm going to provide photos of the attempted scrambled eggs that tasted like I was drinking out of the Galveston, Texas Bay and I‚Äôve never had scrambled eggs that are crunchy. I‚Äôm not joking about waiting. My girlfriend finished all of her food and I waited another 10 for minutes for mine. The server keeps bringing other peoples food to our table and it‚Äôs a health hazard when they touch it and bring it back. We had 3 orders come to our table. Really wish it lived up to the hype.",

As I was ordering I noticed them bringing Costco sized bags of frozen fries, and hashbrowns into the kitchen area. Maybe I‚Äôm naive and that‚Äôs a normal thing for restaurants to do.. i guess I was surprised they were fresh potatoes. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It tasted fine, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think that the chicken was most likely precooked and just deep fried. Waffles were good though. My daughter got a VERY basic two egg (scrambled eggs overcooked) 2 bacon, and two (McDonald‚Äôs style) hash browns. Spent $37 for 2 of us for a meal I feel like I could‚Äôve gotten at a fast food place (minus the chicken and waffles).",
