They were absolutely top notch, a breeze to work with, pure professionalism at all times through the planning to the event and even clean up and follow up. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. Lauren P. was WONDERFUL! We planned via phone and email only since I was hundreds of miles away planning an event in PA. With 2 Pinterest photos she nailed how I wanted the tables to look, what meals would fit for my group, recommendations  on timeline, bread plates or baskets, coffee service, cake served or on the table‚Ä¶all these things I wouldn‚Äôt have ever thought of she broke down. With any change or idea, I‚Äôd have a new proposal in my inbox, never being kept in the dark of costs. Billing was extremely easy. Then the night of everything the staff was AMAZING! The food was delicious ‚Äì so many comments on it and not one on it being cold or anything. The night went off without any hiccups. Everyone was so kind and generous, the room looked gorgeous, food was amazing. I left my name plates that showed the type of food the guests were getting back hundreds of miles away at home and without skipping a beat Lauren figured out a plan B and executed it, no issues just went to work. Amazing experience and I will surely be using them and recommending them for any catering needs!",

We were blown away when we did our food tasting and knew at that point that we made the right choice. Our guests raved about the food, especially the red wine braised beef that you didn‚Äôt even need a knife to cut. The service on our wedding day was excellent and quick, and they are attentive to any allergies that guests have. We worked with Candice during the planning process, and she was always willing to answer any questions. Luke was the catering manager for the night and was wonderful. Driftwood did not disappoint, and I would definitely recommend them for anyone planning a wedding. Thanks again!",

We had beef, chicken piccata, or a whole roast baby cauliflower for our entree choices. Each came with a starch and a vegetable as well. The beef was SO tender. My wife had the cauliflower, which was enormous and delicious from what I heard, and we received numerous compliments about the chicken. Driftwood also provided our cake and cocktail appetizers, which were incredibly delicious as well. We worked with Candice and Mechelle during our process and both were very kind and helpful during the entire process. The tasting was awesome, and very professionally executed. We couldn‚Äôt be happier with the service: the bar and wait staff were off the charts. For our signature cocktail, we chose a strawberry Moscow mule, which I would say is an atypical cocktail, but the bar staff pulled it off wonderfully! I was so impressed. They brought us into the conversation on the day of the event when needed and treated us with the utmost respect. 5 stars all around. You‚Äôre not going to find a better wedding caterer, and the price is incredibly reasonable! We were pleasantly surprised when we saw the numbers! Driftwood is top notch. I‚Äôd recommend them to anyone.",

Our entire experience with her from the tasting to the big day was a blast.

Our entire experience with her from the tasting to the big day was a blast.

Couldn't rate 5/5 stars due to contract manager complications- our person of contact changed multiple times. One of our managers left the company & didn't fulfill promises to fill us in with details prior to leaving. Weeks before our wedding, I was reaching out to staff looking for answers. There were also a discrepancy in the contact regarding the bartenders' tip jar. Overall, didn't change our opinion of the delicious food but some bumps in the road we experienced!",

People kept going back for more. During dinner, everything perfectly cooked, served hot, and extremely tasty. Meg was our event manager and working with her was a breeze! Our entire experience with her from the tasting to the big day was a blast. She went to every table while food was being served to ensure a smooth service, stayed the entire night assisting the waitstaff, AND even snuck in a dance with us. Thank you Meg and Driftwood for a memorable meal and evening!",

They were absolutely top notch, a breeze to work with, pure professionalism at all times through the planning to the event and even clean up and follow up. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. Lauren P. was WONDERFUL! We planned via phone and email only since I was hundreds of miles away planning an event in PA. With 2 Pinterest photos she nailed how I wanted the tables to look, what meals would fit for my group, recommendations  on timeline, bread plates or baskets, coffee service, cake served or on the table‚Ä¶all these things I wouldn‚Äôt have ever thought of she broke down. With any change or idea, I‚Äôd have a new proposal in my inbox, never being kept in the dark of costs. Billing was extremely easy. Then the night of everything the staff was AMAZING! The food was delicious ‚Äì so many comments on it and not one on it being cold or anything. The night went off without any hiccups. Everyone was so kind and generous, the room looked gorgeous, food was amazing. I left my name plates that showed the type of food the guests were getting back hundreds of miles away at home and without skipping a beat Lauren figured out a plan B and executed it, no issues just went to work. Amazing experience and I will surely be using them and recommending them for any catering needs!",

Better venues for a fraction of the cost are out there with far greater options. I only have regrets with this company. Good luck",
