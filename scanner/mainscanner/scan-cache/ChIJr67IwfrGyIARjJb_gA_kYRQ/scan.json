Good customer service. The young lady taking orders was very friendly and even suggested a \"meal deal\" they had going when we visited the restaurant.  Everything was served hot, fresh and was satisfying.  I recommend this restaurant for some tasty quick eats. *side note*  They also had beautiful art for sale on their walls, very cool place.",

The staff helped me with my questions and advised something that would be a great choice to split between my friend and I. Because we had dinner reservations later that evening.\n\nWe ended up ordering the #7 - 14‚Äù pepperoni pizza, 8 wings (lemon pepper & Honey BBQ) and fries. All of it was really good and the right amount to split for two. I would definitely recommend to others to come by and check out Fat Moe‚Äôs.",

Good customer service. The young lady taking orders was very friendly and even suggested a \"meal deal\" they had going when we visited the restaurant.  Everything was served hot, fresh and was satisfying.  I recommend this restaurant for some tasty quick eats. *side note*  They also had beautiful art for sale on their walls, very cool place.",
