          "text": "Cool hang out place with a stage for live music\nThe front features an open, yet covered, deck with multiple types of seating for hanging out.\n\nEntering the front door presents an open room with banquets, tables, high tops, and bar top seating for their full liquor, beer, and wine offerings. Plenty of options to choose from. They even have a nice stage to the left which hosts a variety of live artists rotated and advertised on their website. As far as the experience, this is so quite obviously a local favorite and for good reasons. If you don‚Äôt venture past this first room ,you will miss the amazing surprises offered beyond‚Ä¶\n\nIn a room behind the stage is a very large banquet/multi-use room (and apparently the kitchen is actually beyond that. This has the potential for various gatherings and can provide some privacy.\n\nNow, proceeding to the rear of the main dining is an annex with secondary bar(s), pool tables, and seating. It doesn‚Äôt stop there, as you can then venture into a warehouse-style room with 0-10 organized and measured corn hole set ups. I have heard that this is a favorite place for company outings, fun tournaments, and quite obviously some league play. I have personally never seen so many people show up with their own carry or roll-on bags with personal equipment. I don‚Äôt think I will be playing anyone for $ around here!\n\nWe began with fried mushrooms and they were fresh and piping hot. So fresh and hot, there was a mandatory ‚Äòcooling off‚Äô period we needed to observe! Nice problem to have. We thoroughly enjoyed these little flavor explosions.\n\nWe then ordered the Jack Burger and the Spur Burger. One with fries and one with rings. Both came in a basket with a cool take on the paper liners, which are printed like newspaper pages with articles on cooking recipes, fishing techniques, etc. Super fun.\n\nThe Spur Burger had a good take on the combination of heat with jalape√±os and sweet with bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms and Swiss. My only hesitation here is their choice of meat, which seemed a little grey (weren‚Äôt asked about cook temp preference) and was was a little off the mark for both of us. Pics show that quite well.\n\nOnion rings are a little too thick for my taste and the breading was way too thick (heavy) and mealy. Fries were just fine.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt an occasion for us to sample the bar and such local specials, but I am quite sure this is a big draw of the popularity they enjoy. I will have to try that part another time. This is worth additional visits to participate in all the activities I mentioned that I saw but didn‚Äôt have time to join.\n\nIt is obviously public knowledge that this is an extremely dog friendly destination, and we witnessed multiple guests with their furry friends.\n\nEveryone is greeted joyfully when they walk through the door and the entire staff we encountered were super polite, friendly, and attentive. High marks for our server, Cayla!",

          "text": "Arrived here early Saturday evening. This being my first time here, I was a little disoriented where the entry door was.  FYI, they have a few parking spaces directly in front of the entry way stairs (guaranteed to be occupied), which made it difficult to see an access point when first rolling up.  We were formally welcomed at the door and told it was open seating and to sit wherever we liked.  It still being early, there were only about 50 people in the entire building, including staff.  We chose to sit at the bar, and we were immediately welcomed in & assisted with our drink orders. Drinks promptly served within the first 5 minutes of sitting down. The bar is NOT understaffed, they had at minimum 3 people taking orders and pouring drinks at any given moment..  The atmosphere at the Bar was pleasant with large TVs overhead and visible from multiple angles.  The bartenders and servers were all very polite, and quick to ask if we needed food menus.  We were given menus, and although the menu is not vast, is original and filled with various dishes that are not common everywhere (ie burger, fries etc. even though they do have their own spin on those as well).  Started with some ‚ÄúFrickles‚Äù (Fried Pickles) and were just that, battered and fried pickles, nothing crazy, not super salty, or BAMMED* with a crazy seasoning, very simple almost bland, with a small dip container of ranch dressing.  For an entree, I elected for the Cajun Pasta, which is absolutely AMAZING!!  The plate comes with ample amount of penne pasta, smothered in their own Cajun sauce, complete with peppers, grilled chicken, various spices and a BOLD, but not overpowering kick.  It was perfect for me, some Cajun dishes I have had in the past elsewhere have been too spicy to enjoy, however this was not spicy beyond the normal pallet.  The dish was complimented well with two pieces of soft buttery garlic bread, with just the right amount toasting around the edges.  Ended up having to get a to-go box to pack out the remaining pasta and sauce,  the dish is Very filling, My compliments to the kitchenüôèüèª.  The night ended well with no issues or drama, as my friend and I enjoyed a few more drinks, the staff ensured we had everything we needed and were enjoying our meal and drinks.  The check came due and surprisingly with an appetizer, 2 entrees and 5 adult beverages the bill was only slightly over $70.  By the time we were ready to leave, the place was alive with patrons. Every table was filled and the moment we got up from our spot at the Bar to leave, there was a couple that was laying in wait to immediately pounce at the bar location for fast drinks and immediate service. On our way out the door, it was clear that this place gets hopping as the sun goes down, the live band was preparing for their gig. Sadly we did not stick around for the live music, but we will be coming back in the near future.  Thanks for a Pleasant Evening Mule Barn!",

We both remained calm and moved to the patio, where we had dinner at table #57. The owner displayed a lack of class and did not offer any apology. This lack of accountability reflects poorly on him as a business owner.\n\nYour server apologized and mentioned that this incident had never happened before. While the hamburger was decent, the overall experience felt more like a bar with food rather than a pleasant dining environment.\n\nTo address your comment: You can't claim you don‚Äôt recall; you called out to your black lab to stop, and it followed us to the front door.\n\nI'm not a level 7 reviewer who makes negative reviews lightly, but as a business owner and a native Texan, I understand how challenging it can be to run a business.",

          "text": "Cool hang out place with a stage for live music\nThe front features an open, yet covered, deck with multiple types of seating for hanging out.\n\nEntering the front door presents an open room with banquets, tables, high tops, and bar top seating for their full liquor, beer, and wine offerings. Plenty of options to choose from. They even have a nice stage to the left which hosts a variety of live artists rotated and advertised on their website. As far as the experience, this is so quite obviously a local favorite and for good reasons. If you don‚Äôt venture past this first room ,you will miss the amazing surprises offered beyond‚Ä¶\n\nIn a room behind the stage is a very large banquet/multi-use room (and apparently the kitchen is actually beyond that. This has the potential for various gatherings and can provide some privacy.\n\nNow, proceeding to the rear of the main dining is an annex with secondary bar(s), pool tables, and seating. It doesn‚Äôt stop there, as you can then venture into a warehouse-style room with 0-10 organized and measured corn hole set ups. I have heard that this is a favorite place for company outings, fun tournaments, and quite obviously some league play. I have personally never seen so many people show up with their own carry or roll-on bags with personal equipment. I don‚Äôt think I will be playing anyone for $ around here!\n\nWe began with fried mushrooms and they were fresh and piping hot. So fresh and hot, there was a mandatory ‚Äòcooling off‚Äô period we needed to observe! Nice problem to have. We thoroughly enjoyed these little flavor explosions.\n\nWe then ordered the Jack Burger and the Spur Burger. One with fries and one with rings. Both came in a basket with a cool take on the paper liners, which are printed like newspaper pages with articles on cooking recipes, fishing techniques, etc. Super fun.\n\nThe Spur Burger had a good take on the combination of heat with jalape√±os and sweet with bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms and Swiss. My only hesitation here is their choice of meat, which seemed a little grey (weren‚Äôt asked about cook temp preference) and was was a little off the mark for both of us. Pics show that quite well.\n\nOnion rings are a little too thick for my taste and the breading was way too thick (heavy) and mealy. Fries were just fine.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt an occasion for us to sample the bar and such local specials, but I am quite sure this is a big draw of the popularity they enjoy. I will have to try that part another time. This is worth additional visits to participate in all the activities I mentioned that I saw but didn‚Äôt have time to join.\n\nIt is obviously public knowledge that this is an extremely dog friendly destination, and we witnessed multiple guests with their furry friends.\n\nEveryone is greeted joyfully when they walk through the door and the entire staff we encountered were super polite, friendly, and attentive. High marks for our server, Cayla!",

I have always wanted to try out this place I'm not sure I'll return now. I also inquired why there was a ring inside my drink glass. I was told by the waitress that these classes Came From Another Part of the building and they use them when they get busy well by the time I finish my drink the whole bottom part of the glass was completely White and chalky. The patty melt was $12 will the $3 upcharge for okra and at least 250 for the drink. I wasted 18 bucks for sure.",

Went to the bar and he told me the waitress had picked them up earlier and he would get her to bring them to us. Waited another 15 while no one was doing squat- Went back to the bar and asked if he could please just pour our drinks and I would take them back to the table. Finally got the food order as well. It was just ok-\nGot the bill and they don‚Äôt honor their prices (Tues Beer and tacos in this case)  they show on the website- so beware. Total bait and switch. Other tables were griping about that as well. Wish I could say it was a good experience but my friend group will find another place to relax than here.",
