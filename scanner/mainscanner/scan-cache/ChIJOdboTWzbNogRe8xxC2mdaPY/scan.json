          "text": "So, I'm from NWI, aka, the greater Chicago area. I'm a pizza snob. I've lived in OH for 20 years and Ytown has some of the best pizza around. I've found quite a few gems here in Canton and Akron. When my boss heard me talking about the Italian beef sandwich(signature Chicago sandwich), to a coworker, he said, Try Burratas, they have them. I got so excited. I make them at home but it's a process and since Giordanos closed, nowhere else sells them. So, I called my husband to meet me at Burratas for an Italian beef and pizza. We arrived and it's a weird parking lot but that's typical of the small businesses on Tusc. There are 2 tables on the patio, a small round table right in front of the counter, and a table that seats four that takes up almost all the free space they have. I would say it's more of a take-out place. We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and the Italian Beef sandwich. The pizza and drink prices are a little high. It was $3 a topping. The 2-topping small pizza was $18. The sandwich was reasonably priced at $11. Then my husband got a bottled Modelo which was $5! They only have canned pop so I got a Pepsi for $1.75. She said we could sit outside and come back in about 15 minutes to grab our food. I asked my husband to grab me a glass of ice for my pop.  When my husband went back in to get the food, she informed us they don't have ice but could give me a chilled glass, and she would bring the food out because it wasn't ready yet. It took closer to 45 minutes for the food. Finally, he brought the food out.  I took one look at the \"Italian Beef\" and knew it wasn't authentic. It was ok but not a real Italian beef. No giardinera peppers or even banana peppers, the \"Au Jus\" was typical Ohio style, beef broth. The pizza was good but for $18 I'll pass. Also, as soon as the food came, gnats swarmed us. Very hard to enjoy anything while swatting at bugs the entire time. Not sure we will be back.",

Delicious crust, cup pepperoni, and maybe my favorite pizza sauce in the area now. My husband and kids loved it too! Giving our normal pizza spot a run for their money.\n\nThanks Burrata, we will be back!",

          "text": "So, I'm from NWI, aka, the greater Chicago area. I'm a pizza snob. I've lived in OH for 20 years and Ytown has some of the best pizza around. I've found quite a few gems here in Canton and Akron. When my boss heard me talking about the Italian beef sandwich(signature Chicago sandwich), to a coworker, he said, Try Burratas, they have them. I got so excited. I make them at home but it's a process and since Giordanos closed, nowhere else sells them. So, I called my husband to meet me at Burratas for an Italian beef and pizza. We arrived and it's a weird parking lot but that's typical of the small businesses on Tusc. There are 2 tables on the patio, a small round table right in front of the counter, and a table that seats four that takes up almost all the free space they have. I would say it's more of a take-out place. We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and the Italian Beef sandwich. The pizza and drink prices are a little high. It was $3 a topping. The 2-topping small pizza was $18. The sandwich was reasonably priced at $11. Then my husband got a bottled Modelo which was $5! They only have canned pop so I got a Pepsi for $1.75. She said we could sit outside and come back in about 15 minutes to grab our food. I asked my husband to grab me a glass of ice for my pop.  When my husband went back in to get the food, she informed us they don't have ice but could give me a chilled glass, and she would bring the food out because it wasn't ready yet. It took closer to 45 minutes for the food. Finally, he brought the food out.  I took one look at the \"Italian Beef\" and knew it wasn't authentic. It was ok but not a real Italian beef. No giardinera peppers or even banana peppers, the \"Au Jus\" was typical Ohio style, beef broth. The pizza was good but for $18 I'll pass. Also, as soon as the food came, gnats swarmed us. Very hard to enjoy anything while swatting at bugs the entire time. Not sure we will be back.",
