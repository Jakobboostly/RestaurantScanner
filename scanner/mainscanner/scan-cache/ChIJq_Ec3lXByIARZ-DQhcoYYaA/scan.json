The atmosphere was fun and unique, with live entertainment the night we visited, an Elvis/Tom Jones impersonator that really added to the vibe.\n\nThe food? Absolutely phenomenal. Hands down the best Italian food I‚Äôve ever had. It doesn‚Äôt even compare to chain restaurants like Olive Garden, it‚Äôs on a whole different level. The arugula salad was fresh and flavorful, the chicken marsala was amazing, and the cucumber martini was the best martini I‚Äôve ever had.\n\nOur waiter and the entire staff were wonderful, attentive, kind, fun and made the evening feel special. I‚Äôd give this place 5 stars without hesitation and would absolutely come back next time I‚Äôm in Vegas.\n\nThe only downside? They don't have a location in my home state!",

I get its  Vegas and things are supposed to be fun but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the speakeasy concept or having to wait in the heat for someone to let me in.  My focus is on the food.  Some people might enjoy the speakeasy concept and entertainment aspects of this place much more than me.  The place is cool looking and kept a little dark.  The host and staff were friendly, and the food came out quick.  The food was good, not great.  Ma‚Äôs meatball and sausage was a unique dish.  It had some spicy sauce that had a lot of flavor.  The meatball was above average, but not exceptional..  The sausage was probably the best part of the meal.  It was authentic Italian sausage that was juicy and had a zesty flavor.  Santucci‚Äôs spaghetti was okay.  The red sauce is good, but not great.  It came with a full piece of sausage.  The portion sizes are massive so think about sharing.  They had a Sinatra style singer playing in the lounge and taking requests, which was a nice touch.  You could still have a conversation at the table.  My major complaint is the tables to the side of the bar are situated so you are eerily and uncomfortably close to the people on the other side of the wall in the dining room.  If you turn your head, you are staring in someone‚Äôs face.  The prices are on the low end.  I would probably go back because they really did try to make sure we had a great and fun experience.",
