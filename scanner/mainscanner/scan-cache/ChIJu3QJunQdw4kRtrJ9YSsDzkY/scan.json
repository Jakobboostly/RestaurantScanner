          "text": "Can‚Äôt say enough good words about Frank‚Äôs Pizza! My family has used Frank‚Äôs for catering a number of times, always with an excellent experience and reviews from our party guests of how good the food is.\nWe just had a party for our son who just turned two, and we used their restaurant space, for the first time, in the rear section of the restaurant for our entire party of 35 guests. What a gem of a convenience to be able to have a beautiful space to use, right in the restaurant where the food is! We did keep it simple and just had a pizza party, with chicken fingers and fries. Who raves about pizza, chicken fingers, and fries? My guests certainly did!! We‚Äôve definitely had other food here before and are never disappointed.\nThe staff‚Ä¶.I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff! They are always super friendly when we are there, and they are very accommodating! They let me come in and decorate for the party beforehand and there was pretty much nothing I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do as far as the decorating went.\nBarbara was our waitress. She was AMAZING and super sweet! She even helped with the decorating. She was attentive with anything we needed at any time. And that was even while serving tables additionally throughout the restaurant.\nAngelo, the owner of Frank‚Äôs Pizza, is an absolute pleasure to work with! He is a happy guy and you can tell he loves his job. He‚Äôll sit down with you to go over the menu, or you can do it right over the phone. He helps in making suggestions, but is never pushy and gives you an idea of what is the right amount of food for your party.\nFrank‚Äôs Pizza helped make our 2 year old‚Äôs Monster Truck birthday party a huge success, and it will be a memory that will last for years to come!\nThank you!!!",

The staff is exceptionally friendly, making you feel right at home. But the true star here is the pizza‚Äîcrafted with precision and care. The crust strikes the perfect balance between crisp and chewy, the sauce is rich and bursting with flavor, and the toppings are fresh and plentiful. It's clear that attention to detail is a priority here, making Frank's Pizza not just a place to eat, but a destination for quality and taste. A true pizza lover's paradise!",

My family has used Frank‚Äôs for catering a number of times, always with an excellent experience and reviews from our party guests of how good the food is.\nWe just had a party for our son who just turned two, and we used their restaurant space, for the first time, in the rear section of the restaurant for our entire party of 35 guests. What a gem of a convenience to be able to have a beautiful space to use, right in the restaurant where the food is! We did keep it simple and just had a pizza party, with chicken fingers and fries. Who raves about pizza, chicken fingers, and fries? My guests certainly did!! We‚Äôve definitely had other food here before and are never disappointed.\nThe staff‚Ä¶.I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff! They are always super friendly when we are there, and they are very accommodating! They let me come in and decorate for the party beforehand and there was pretty much nothing I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do as far as the decorating went.\nBarbara was our waitress. She was AMAZING and super sweet! She even helped with the decorating. She was attentive with anything we needed at any time. And that was even while serving tables additionally throughout the restaurant.\nAngelo, the owner of Frank‚Äôs Pizza, is an absolute pleasure to work with! He is a happy guy and you can tell he loves his job. He‚Äôll sit down with you to go over the menu, or you can do it right over the phone. He helps in making suggestions, but is never pushy and gives you an idea of what is the right amount of food for your party.\nFrank‚Äôs Pizza helped make our 2 year old‚Äôs Monster Truck birthday party a huge success, and it will be a memory that will last for years to come!\nThank you!!!",

The staff is exceptionally friendly, making you feel right at home. But the true star here is the pizza‚Äîcrafted with precision and care. The crust strikes the perfect balance between crisp and chewy, the sauce is rich and bursting with flavor, and the toppings are fresh and plentiful. It's clear that attention to detail is a priority here, making Frank's Pizza not just a place to eat, but a destination for quality and taste. A true pizza lover's paradise!",

            "text": "Can‚Äôt say enough good words about Frank‚Äôs Pizza! My family has used Frank‚Äôs for catering a number of times, always with an excellent experience and reviews from our party guests of how good the food is.\nWe just had a party for our son who just turned two, and we used their restaurant space, for the first time, in the rear section of the restaurant for our entire party of 35 guests. What a gem of a convenience to be able to have a beautiful space to use, right in the restaurant where the food is! We did keep it simple and just had a pizza party, with chicken fingers and fries. Who raves about pizza, chicken fingers, and fries? My guests certainly did!! We‚Äôve definitely had other food here before and are never disappointed.\nThe staff‚Ä¶.I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff! They are always super friendly when we are there, and they are very accommodating! They let me come in and decorate for the party beforehand and there was pretty much nothing I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do as far as the decorating went.\nBarbara was our waitress. She was AMAZING and super sweet! She even helped with the decorating. She was attentive with anything we needed at any time. And that was even while serving tables additionally throughout the restaurant.\nAngelo, the owner of Frank‚Äôs Pizza, is an absolute pleasure to work with! He is a happy guy and you can tell he loves his job. He‚Äôll sit down with you to go over the menu, or you can do it right over the phone. He helps in making suggestions, but is never pushy and gives you an idea of what is the right amount of food for your party.\nFrank‚Äôs Pizza helped make our 2 year old‚Äôs Monster Truck birthday party a huge success, and it will be a memory that will last for years to come!\nThank you!!!",
