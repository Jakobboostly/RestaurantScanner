Other than the mushrooms on top, it was also very bland. Overall, it was a very disappointing dish and poorly delivered. Seems unacceptable for a place like this for the main dish to be so poorly done.\n2. Our waitress was stretched thin or not good. We had to ask another server to get her attention twice as she just wasn't stopping by or even looking our way. Our food was delivered at weird stages even though we had made it pretty obvious which appetizer was to be a main dish for us. Combined with the I'll timed and prepared veal, I am wondering if our server was the problem all along.\n\nOverall, a decent experience with some disappointments. I'd still give them another chance since some of the food was still very good.",

Other than the mushrooms on top, it was also very bland. Overall, it was a very disappointing dish and poorly delivered. Seems unacceptable for a place like this for the main dish to be so poorly done.\n2. Our waitress was stretched thin or not good. We had to ask another server to get her attention twice as she just wasn't stopping by or even looking our way. Our food was delivered at weird stages even though we had made it pretty obvious which appetizer was to be a main dish for us. Combined with the I'll timed and prepared veal, I am wondering if our server was the problem all along.\n\nOverall, a decent experience with some disappointments. I'd still give them another chance since some of the food was still very good.",

          "text": "We had an amazing evening at Convivio. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, as the place is newly decorated with tasteful lighting and smooth background music that set the tone for a relaxed dinner.\n\nThe food was outstanding. We started with the ‚Äúbruschetta rossa‚Äù, which was a perfect combination of toasted fresh bread, just the right hint of garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella. It was simple, fresh, and delicious. For the main course, we had the ‚Äúgnocchi al funghi‚Äù and the  ‚Äúrigatoni‚Äù. Both pasta dishes were flawlessly prepared and full of flavor. The wine selection was another highlight, offering flexibility with 6oz, 9oz, or full bottle options at very good price.\n\nBut what truly elevated the experience was the service. Our server, Sam H, was exceptional. He took the time to explain the menu in a helpful, approachable way and genuinely connected with us, asking where we were from and what brought us to Indy. It wasn‚Äôt just great service, it was hospitality at its finest. We felt truly welcome, not just as customers but as guests. Please, whoever reads this from the restaurant, make sure to pass it along to him.\n\nWe‚Äôre already looking forward to coming back‚Äîand next time, we‚Äôre bringing friends. Highly recommend!",

          "text": "A very beautiful environment with friendly and helpful wait staff, but the food is just okay.\n\nI came here with a group of friends. I ordered their lavender French 75 cocktail, which was pretty good. A little too lemony, but with hints of lavender, bergamot, and floral gin which were nice.\n\nI also ordered the Pasta Roman, made with squid ink pasta, shrimp, and lobster. It was just okay. (Maybe I didn't look at the menu closely enough, but I expected it to come in an ink sauce. My mistake.) I felt like it was a pretty bland pasta in cream sauce with some seafood thrown on top. Nothing memorable.\n\nI thought it was just me, at first. However, the consensus in our group was that our food was missing something. Everything lacked depth and punch, in my opinion. My friend described it as under-seasoned. I think that's a fair assessment.\n\nThanks for having us, but we won't return.",
