They sat us down right away and had our drinks on the table pretty quickly (this is a big plus for me), then gave us all the time we needed.  Nice menu with several specials.  I was happy to see the menu had some nice dishes that stood out from the bar like food you find all over Myrtle Beach.  I had a very tasty seafood meal.  The dessert was pretty standard, nothing all that special but good.  The waiter was very good.  He knew everything on the menu and was even able to state many of the ingredients and how it was cooked.  He was always there when we needed him and he never rushed us.  The price is a bit higher than the average for Myrtle Beach but the food is also equally better than the average.  You‚Äôve heard it before, you get what you pay for.  I did enjoy myself at Gios and will be returning.",

Unfortunately, that's where the positive aspects of our visit ended. After being seated, we were completely ignored by the waitstaff for over 30 minutes. We could see other tables that had arrived after us receiving attention and service, but we were left sitting there, wondering if anyone would even acknowledge us.\nAfter waiting and trying to get someone's attention, we realized that it wasn‚Äôt just a small mistake. The service was just absent. There was no explanation, no apology, nothing. Eventually, we decided to leave because, at that point, we had lost our patience. We didn't even get the chance to order anything, which was a huge disappointment because we were genuinely looking forward to trying their Italian dishes.\nThe restaurant wasn't busy, and we could clearly see that tables around us were getting served, so it wasn‚Äôt a staffing issue. It felt like we were being completely disregarded, and that's just unacceptable in any dining experience.\nI won‚Äôt be returning anytime soon, and I would definitely suggest looking elsewhere for a better dining experience. Poor service can really ruin an otherwise great opportunity, and unfortunately, Gio Italian Restaurant missed the mark entirely\n\nEdit as it will not let me respond.\nWe did let someone know‚Ä¶.. she went to the hostess stand where they talked for about 3 minutes to the other hostess. None of that staff moved to get a manager. It was at that point we decided to leave. I would be more than happy to reach out to the owner manager about this. But was afraid I would be ignored like I was in your restaurant. As far as my other reviews. I am fully aware of my ‚Äúother‚Äù reviews as I really only feel compelled to write them after horrible experiences. Which lucky for you I got one there.",

Went through every part of of the ordering process and upselling/ suggesting along the way.\n\nPre-appetizer came immediately after and my salad shortly after that. My appetizer had gotten forgotten but my server kept me updated a couple of times on its progress. I ended up getting it just before my main course. The meatball gios, the special salad dressing, chicken scarpiello...all bravissimo.\n\nWorth a repeat visit sometime during my next MB visit.",

Sadly, I‚Äôm not sure what happened however something has changed or is headed in the wrong direction. To set the stage, my wife and I sat at the bar around 7pm with only one other patron at the bar and I would say the restaurant was at 50% occupancy at best. It took at least 10 minutes for the bar tender to recognize us. Once recognized some waters were brought over. It took another 10-15 minutes for us to order a drink only after gently reminding the bar tender. Once our food order was placed, the service time was within expectation. Now for the food, and again I thought Gios had some of the best Italian in MB. We ordered the Mediterranean Veal and I the Meatballs and Sausage.  I will speak to the basics of my meal, the sausage and meatballs. The pasta was overcooked and the meatballs were soggy while the sausage overly blackened and squishy. Not what I expected and hopefully this was just a one off experience for the subpar service at the bar and quality of their food. I‚Äôd love to go back and support the restaurant but not at the expense of this recent experience. Hope they can figure out the weak link. I hesitated to write this review but perhaps it won‚Äôt fall on deaf ears.",

The food is amazing as well, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but Rose made a night that was spiraling a great experience.\n\nThree of the five of us got the penne alla vodka and it was so creamy and delicious. We took leftovers home, that typically end up in the trash, but you best believe not this time!  My 6yo loved the fettuccine alfredo. My husband said the chicken Marsala was very tender and yummy.\n\nThe ONLY downside was the hostess. Classic case of ‚Äúthe child doesn‚Äôt count as a full body‚Äù and she wanted to wedge four grown adults and a child in a booth. A note to the hostess, children actually take up more space than an average person because they wiggle‚Ä¶a lot!  Parents want to be comfortable and enjoy their meal, especially when they‚Äôre on vacation and not having to be the one to tend to people for once. And yes, we complained until she FINALLY got the hint and relocated us. If I‚Äôm spending over $100 on dinner I better be comfortable. It would‚Äôve been a whole different story had the place been busy, but it absolutely was not.",

They sat us down right away and had our drinks on the table pretty quickly (this is a big plus for me), then gave us all the time we needed.  Nice menu with several specials.  I was happy to see the menu had some nice dishes that stood out from the bar like food you find all over Myrtle Beach.  I had a very tasty seafood meal.  The dessert was pretty standard, nothing all that special but good.  The waiter was very good.  He knew everything on the menu and was even able to state many of the ingredients and how it was cooked.  He was always there when we needed him and he never rushed us.  The price is a bit higher than the average for Myrtle Beach but the food is also equally better than the average.  You‚Äôve heard it before, you get what you pay for.  I did enjoy myself at Gios and will be returning.",

Our first signal should've been that on a Friday night in Myrtle Beach at 6 o'clock and the restaurant was more than half empty.\nWe both ordered the special, it was a seafood Fra Diavolo. $40. Probably 10 bites of linguine, two shrimp, two small scallops, seven minute clams and the smallest lobster tail I've ever seen in my life! Two bites,\nWith all that being said, pasta is very inexpensive! It was doused in sauce, but no pasta???\nAnd was so hot, it was almost inedible?\nJust fair warning to all of that think they're going out for some good Italian food, I couldn't care less what the restaurant has to reply with. Shame on them. This is just an honest review of a restaurant knowingly, ripping people off . Do not waste your time.",

Unfortunately, that's where the positive aspects of our visit ended. After being seated, we were completely ignored by the waitstaff for over 30 minutes. We could see other tables that had arrived after us receiving attention and service, but we were left sitting there, wondering if anyone would even acknowledge us.\nAfter waiting and trying to get someone's attention, we realized that it wasn‚Äôt just a small mistake. The service was just absent. There was no explanation, no apology, nothing. Eventually, we decided to leave because, at that point, we had lost our patience. We didn't even get the chance to order anything, which was a huge disappointment because we were genuinely looking forward to trying their Italian dishes.\nThe restaurant wasn't busy, and we could clearly see that tables around us were getting served, so it wasn‚Äôt a staffing issue. It felt like we were being completely disregarded, and that's just unacceptable in any dining experience.\nI won‚Äôt be returning anytime soon, and I would definitely suggest looking elsewhere for a better dining experience. Poor service can really ruin an otherwise great opportunity, and unfortunately, Gio Italian Restaurant missed the mark entirely\n\nEdit as it will not let me respond.\nWe did let someone know‚Ä¶.. she went to the hostess stand where they talked for about 3 minutes to the other hostess. None of that staff moved to get a manager. It was at that point we decided to leave. I would be more than happy to reach out to the owner manager about this. But was afraid I would be ignored like I was in your restaurant. As far as my other reviews. I am fully aware of my ‚Äúother‚Äù reviews as I really only feel compelled to write them after horrible experiences. Which lucky for you I got one there.",

I discovered this place a  couple years ago and now make sure to visit when in town. This time I took the waitress/bartenders recommendation and ordered the Alfredo with chicken. Outstanding! (And I'm picky when it comes to Alfredo sauce). It's just right..not too thin and not too thick/creamy. Also, this literally had THREE chicken breasts. Several people walking by commented on how much food there was on plate. You will definitely not leave hungry. I've also had the lasagna in the past which is excellent also.",

          "text": "We‚Äôve been to this restaurant before and had a great experience, even though some of the prices are a bit high for what you get ‚Äî we felt the quality justified it. Unfortunately, our most recent visit for our anniversary was disappointing enough that we won‚Äôt be coming back.\n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess asked if we had a reservation. We didn‚Äôt, but the place was pretty empty, so we didn‚Äôt think it would be a problem. Still, she looked stressed and told us we‚Äôd get our food faster if we sat at the bar instead of a table. That made little sense, but we agreed to be accommodating.\n\nWe placed our orders, but 5‚Äì10 minutes later, our server returned to ask what protein I wanted with my pasta ‚Äî something that should‚Äôve been clarified up front. Assuming it came with the meal, I asked for a chicken cutlet.\n\nAfter finishing our appetizer, we waited an extremely long time for our entrees. The restaurant was far from busy, so the delay didn‚Äôt make much sense, but we were patient. Then, mid-conversation, a woman (who never introduced herself but seemed to be a manager) abruptly came over to our table. She was blunt and honestly pretty rude ‚Äî she just said, ‚ÄúYour food is coming,‚Äù and added that they‚Äôd been busy with a reserved party. She asked if we needed anything, but it didn‚Äôt feel like a genuine offer, and definitely didn‚Äôt seem like she was offering anything complimentary, so we declined. The whole interaction felt dismissive and unprofessional.\n\nWhen our meals finally arrived, my wife‚Äôs dish was fine. Mine, on the other hand, was terrible. The pasta was overcooked to the point it was falling apart, the sauce had a burnt flavor, and the ‚Äúchicken cutlet‚Äù turned out to be two dry, grilled pieces of chicken that were hard to chew and not appetizing at all.\n\nI didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene on our anniversary, so I planned to quietly pay and leave. But the waiter noticed I hadn‚Äôt touched my food and asked if something was wrong. I told him honestly. He said they always appreciate feedback and would talk to the chef. Ten minutes later, he returned to tell me the noodles were made fresh that day (as if that explained the overcooking) and then handed me the full check ‚Äî including an extra charge for the chicken I didn‚Äôt want and didn‚Äôt eat.\nAfter seeing how the manager had handled things earlier, I didn‚Äôt feel it was worth pushing further. I paid the bill and we left. Honestly, it felt like being robbed.\n\nWe‚Äôve never had an experience like this ‚Äî not just the poor food, but the way the whole situation was handled. What should‚Äôve been a special night ended up being frustrating and disappointing. We won‚Äôt be back.\nResponse: üòÇ It‚Äôs interesting that this is considered a fine dining establishment, yet the only other couple at the bar was vaping the entire time‚Äîin full view of us and your staff‚Äîwithout a single word said. On top of that, multiple guests were wearing hats, yet you choose to react defensively when someone offers valid criticism about your conduct. Rather than addressing concerns constructively, you dismiss them.",

She anticipated everything we needed before we even had to ask, gave spot-on recommendations (definitely try the meatballs & escargot!), and managed to be both professional and genuinely friendly. Her timing was perfect, and her energy made our whole night even more enjoyable.\n\nThe food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, but Rose truly made this experience unforgettable. Gio‚Äôs, you‚Äôve got a gem on your team‚Äîgive that woman a raise!\n\nHighly recommend dining here and asking for Rose if you want a next-level dining experience.",

Sadly, I‚Äôm not sure what happened however something has changed or is headed in the wrong direction. To set the stage, my wife and I sat at the bar around 7pm with only one other patron at the bar and I would say the restaurant was at 50% occupancy at best. It took at least 10 minutes for the bar tender to recognize us. Once recognized some waters were brought over. It took another 10-15 minutes for us to order a drink only after gently reminding the bar tender. Once our food order was placed, the service time was within expectation. Now for the food, and again I thought Gios had some of the best Italian in MB. We ordered the Mediterranean Veal and I the Meatballs and Sausage.  I will speak to the basics of my meal, the sausage and meatballs. The pasta was overcooked and the meatballs were soggy while the sausage overly blackened and squishy. Not what I expected and hopefully this was just a one off experience for the subpar service at the bar and quality of their food. I‚Äôd love to go back and support the restaurant but not at the expense of this recent experience. Hope they can figure out the weak link. I hesitated to write this review but perhaps it won‚Äôt fall on deaf ears.",
