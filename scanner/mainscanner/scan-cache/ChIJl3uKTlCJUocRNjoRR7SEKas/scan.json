The food was great in all! At first my wife and I were both underwhelmed. The simplicity of the ingredients and spices almost made it seem bland..? But after 1 slice it began to pick up and I must say we both appreciated the way the pizza picks up as you eat it. It almost helps you taste each ingredient on its own and given its very fresh, it makes for a wonderful meal. The this crust was so soft on the inside and still crisp on the outside. The flavor of the dough was delicious as well! The whole vibe here is great! We showed up in casual clothing while most people here were dressed nice and it still felt relaxed and comfortable. They only have a soda fountain which is okay but some specialty drinks would be a nice addition. The service was nice. I still tipped even though there‚Äôs not a lot of interaction between employees. You also tip before you order your food. The lighting and ambiance is mellow, dark and chill. Definitely worth trying and my wife and I will be back when it gets just a little warmer so we can eat outside! Side note, they have a cute little pizza matching game to play while you wait, they come in cool little pizza boxes up in the front. They also have boxes in the front I just pack your own food up which is convenient.",

This place is more than just a fun theme; it‚Äôs a well-run restaurant with seriously good food.\n\nThere are plenty of options on the menu, but I went with the pizza‚Äîand not just any pizza. Be sure do some research on the secret Sandlot menu before going. The pizzas are cleverly named after characters from the movie, like the ‚ÄúBenny the Jet Rodriguez,‚Äù ‚ÄúKenny,‚Äù ‚ÄúSquints,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTimmy and Tommy.‚Äù\n\nI had done my homework and ordered the Timmy and Tommy‚Äîa thin crust, half cheese, half pepperoni pizza. It was spot on. My son had recommended Bambino‚Äôs to me, and when I texted him that I finally went, his response was: ‚ÄúThe best pizza in Utah.‚Äù He might just be right.\n\nWith so many great options and a fun, nostalgic atmosphere, this place really stands out. I don‚Äôt hand out 5-star ratings easily, but The Bambino absolutely earned it. A must, must stop for pizza lovers and Sandlot fans alike.",

Ordered the Margherita and a cheese pizza + arugula salad.\n\nThe salad was outstanding.  The lemon vinegar dressing along with the pine nuts and fresh parm were a perfect combo.  I could have had just the salad and walked away happy.\n\nI‚Äôve read other reviews of soggy crust.  Not this time.  The crust was thin with just the right amount of firmness and crunch to it.  No flop.  Sauce was perfect.  Fresh basil.  Excellent.\n\nThe plain cheese was also great.   Really gives you a sense for how good the sauce and crust are.  Excellent on both accounts.\n\nWe were there on Prom night so the service was slow.  That‚Äôs ok. Totally get it and the young lady who brought out our food was very apologetic.  I have to assess my stars based on that experience tho.  I doubt it‚Äôs the norm‚Ä¶.\n\nAtmosphere was cool.  Spacious place.  They have done a nice job with decor and mixing modern with nostalgia.  Impressed.  The only con is it was a free for all when it came to getting a table.  It‚Äôs self seating.  Again, prom night made it tough but I‚Äôm imagining it is like this on any busy night.  Having people come to your table and ask how much longer you will be a couple times is a buzz kill on the atmosphere.\n\nWill go again.  Overall it‚Äôs a solid 5 for the food and that is what really matters.",

We tried several different pizzas and overall liked them all but felt like they were too skimpy with the meat for the price. The sausage tasted like meatballs which was yummy. My friends liked the peach pizza a lot. The street corn pizza felt like it was missing something but was still yummy. The pork carnitas pizza was spicy but very yummy. Overall great, just need more meat and better pricing",

We tried several different pizzas and overall liked them all but felt like they were too skimpy with the meat for the price. The sausage tasted like meatballs which was yummy. My friends liked the peach pizza a lot. The street corn pizza felt like it was missing something but was still yummy. The pork carnitas pizza was spicy but very yummy. Overall great, just need more meat and better pricing",

The food was great in all! At first my wife and I were both underwhelmed. The simplicity of the ingredients and spices almost made it seem bland..? But after 1 slice it began to pick up and I must say we both appreciated the way the pizza picks up as you eat it. It almost helps you taste each ingredient on its own and given its very fresh, it makes for a wonderful meal. The this crust was so soft on the inside and still crisp on the outside. The flavor of the dough was delicious as well! The whole vibe here is great! We showed up in casual clothing while most people here were dressed nice and it still felt relaxed and comfortable. They only have a soda fountain which is okay but some specialty drinks would be a nice addition. The service was nice. I still tipped even though there‚Äôs not a lot of interaction between employees. You also tip before you order your food. The lighting and ambiance is mellow, dark and chill. Definitely worth trying and my wife and I will be back when it gets just a little warmer so we can eat outside! Side note, they have a cute little pizza matching game to play while you wait, they come in cool little pizza boxes up in the front. They also have boxes in the front I just pack your own food up which is convenient.",

          "text": "I always leave my reviews based on the food.  That‚Äôs why we go, right?\n\nSo let‚Äôs start there.  Ordered the Margherita and a cheese pizza + arugula salad.\n\nThe salad was outstanding.  The lemon vinegar dressing along with the pine nuts and fresh parm were a perfect combo.  I could have had just the salad and walked away happy.\n\nI‚Äôve read other reviews of soggy crust.  Not this time.  The crust was thin with just the right amount of firmness and crunch to it.  No flop.  Sauce was perfect.  Fresh basil.  Excellent.\n\nThe plain cheese was also great.   Really gives you a sense for how good the sauce and crust are.  Excellent on both accounts.\n\nWe were there on Prom night so the service was slow.  That‚Äôs ok. Totally get it and the young lady who brought out our food was very apologetic.  I have to assess my stars based on that experience tho.  I doubt it‚Äôs the norm‚Ä¶.\n\nAtmosphere was cool.  Spacious place.  They have done a nice job with decor and mixing modern with nostalgia.  Impressed.  The only con is it was a free for all when it came to getting a table.  It‚Äôs self seating.  Again, prom night made it tough but I‚Äôm imagining it is like this on any busy night.  Having people come to your table and ask how much longer you will be a couple times is a buzz kill on the atmosphere.\n\nWill go again.  Overall it‚Äôs a solid 5 for the food and that is what really matters.",
