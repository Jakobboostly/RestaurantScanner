If you can think of any random sandwich chain brand as the baseline for a decent sandwich shop, Simply Subs is AT LEAST two rungs higher on the ladder. I will be coming back on my next pass through.\n\nI ordered the super steak (pictured below is the half I didn't immediately eat) for about 14$ which I think is reasonable for what is basically two big sandwiches. They REALLY pile all kinds of stuff on the sandwich. It was probably twice the thickness of sandwiches at other shops.\n\nWhat else can I say? The meat was juicy without being oily, the sandwich wasn't drenched in condiments while still being satisfyingly messy, and the Mancini roll soaked it all up like a sponge.\n\nAlso the picnic benches outside are a nice touch.",

I thought the price ($13.95) was very reasonable for a sub this packed with ingredients. But, know that there's a basic cheesesteak on the menu as well for only $10.95.\n\nThere isn't any inside seating, but there are three full picnic benches behind the building.\n\nI ordered and waited in my car while it was made. Knowing how it works now, I may order before I leave my house, just in case they get busy. The wait today wasn't more than just a few minutes.\n\nShe told me they are working on getting a soft serve ice cream machine. And it's definitely worth mentioning, the staff were really friendly!!\n\nI just love small, family owned businesses like this. It's a win-win to eat something delicious while supporting local businesses.",

          "text": "Had a fantastic sub from Simply Subs on Rt 8. I had the \"Super Steak\" with everything on it + mayo.  I thought the price ($13.95) was very reasonable for a sub this packed with ingredients. But, know that there's a basic cheesesteak on the menu as well for only $10.95.\n\nThere isn't any inside seating, but there are three full picnic benches behind the building.\n\nI ordered and waited in my car while it was made. Knowing how it works now, I may order before I leave my house, just in case they get busy. The wait today wasn't more than just a few minutes.\n\nShe told me they are working on getting a soft serve ice cream machine. And it's definitely worth mentioning, the staff were really friendly!!\n\nI just love small, family owned businesses like this. It's a win-win to eat something delicious while supporting local businesses.",

If you can think of any random sandwich chain brand as the baseline for a decent sandwich shop, Simply Subs is AT LEAST two rungs higher on the ladder. I will be coming back on my next pass through.\n\nI ordered the super steak (pictured below is the half I didn't immediately eat) for about 14$ which I think is reasonable for what is basically two big sandwiches. They REALLY pile all kinds of stuff on the sandwich. It was probably twice the thickness of sandwiches at other shops.\n\nWhat else can I say? The meat was juicy without being oily, the sandwich wasn't drenched in condiments while still being satisfyingly messy, and the Mancini roll soaked it all up like a sponge.\n\nAlso the picnic benches outside are a nice touch.",

The sandwiches are available in many flavors. During my visit, the employees spoke nicely but had a bit of a wait. My veggie sub and my husband's ham-cheese sub tasted good. No indoor seating is available here.",

I thought the price ($13.95) was very reasonable for a sub this packed with ingredients. But, know that there's a basic cheesesteak on the menu as well for only $10.95.\n\nThere isn't any inside seating, but there are three full picnic benches behind the building.\n\nI ordered and waited in my car while it was made. Knowing how it works now, I may order before I leave my house, just in case they get busy. The wait today wasn't more than just a few minutes.\n\nShe told me they are working on getting a soft serve ice cream machine. And it's definitely worth mentioning, the staff were really friendly!!\n\nI just love small, family owned businesses like this. It's a win-win to eat something delicious while supporting local businesses.",
