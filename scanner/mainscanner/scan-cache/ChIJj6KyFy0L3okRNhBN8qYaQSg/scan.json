All of their baked goods (cookies, cupcakes, muffins, etc.) are absolutely delicious and always stand out in my mind.\n\nThe best thing about bountiful bread is the service, particularly from the front of house/cashiers. Always greeted with a smile and a helpful word, the two women who I see regularly on the weekends are absolutely a highlight.\n\nI would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys tasty baked goods, and a warm welcoming environment.",
