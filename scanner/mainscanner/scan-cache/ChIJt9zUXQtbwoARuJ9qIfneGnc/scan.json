They bring them out soggy and lukewarm. As if they sauced them and let them sit for 10 minutes before they bring them out. They had absolutely no \"crunch\". With a tip we paid just over 50 bucks for a \"large\" pizza and 12 wings. No drinks. There's better options out there for that much money. I'm probably coming off as a cheapskate, but my wife and I don't have a problem spending $50 to $100 once or twice a week if the food is good. If I ever come back it'll probably be just to pick up a pepperoni pizza.",

          "text": "This was our first meal back in the US after spending two weeks in Japan. We knew any meat or seafood we got would not compete with the food in Japan, so we opted for some pasta and pizza. While there isn‚Äôt anything particularly special about this place, the food was very good! Service was a little bit slow, but well worth the food. We got the basic comfort foods including pasta and pizza. The spaghetti was delicious and filling. After a very long and tiring 10 hour flight to LAX, this really hit the spot! Portion sizes were large and the prices were relatively low for the Palmdale area. We definitely recommend it for those in the area.",

With a tip we paid just over 50 bucks for a \"large\" pizza and 12 wings. No drinks. There's better options out there for that much money.

We got the basic comfort foods including pasta and pizza. The spaghetti was delicious and filling. After a very long and tiring 10 hour flight to LAX, this really hit the spot!

I'm probably coming off as a cheapskate, but my wife and I don't have a problem spending $50 to $100 once or twice a week if the food is good. If I ever come back it'll probably be just to pick up a pepperoni pizza.",

It was nice and quiet when we got there and it got a bit busier as our meal continued, but we were able to have a nice conversation along with a delicious dinner on our special day. And by signing up for texts we saved $5.",

            "text": "This was our first meal back in the US after spending two weeks in Japan. We knew any meat or seafood we got would not compete with the food in Japan, so we opted for some pasta and pizza. While there isn‚Äôt anything particularly special about this place, the food was very good! Service was a little bit slow, but well worth the food. We got the basic comfort foods including pasta and pizza. The spaghetti was delicious and filling. After a very long and tiring 10 hour flight to LAX, this really hit the spot! Portion sizes were large and the prices were relatively low for the Palmdale area. We definitely recommend it for those in the area.",
