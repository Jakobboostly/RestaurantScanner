It was cooked to buttery perfection and paired with juicy, lightly roasted pears üçê and crisp-tender broccoli ü•¶ ‚Äî such a creative and delicious combination that brought out the richness of the fish.\n\nThe Caesar salad ü•ó was classic and satisfying, with a creamy, flavorful dressing. The steak ü•© on top was decent ‚Äî cooked well but could have been a little more seasoned to stand out.\n\nThe honey-roasted carrots ü•ï with goat cheese üßÄ were a fun side dish! Sweet and savory with that tangy goat cheese kick, although the portion size was definitely on the smaller side.\n\nOverall, the food was really good and thoughtfully prepared üçΩÔ∏è.

My recent expedition to Tonic Seafood & Steak in Wilmington was nothing short of spectacular. Picture this: a balmy evening, stars peeking out, and my amazing girlfriend by my side as we dined al fresco in an atmosphere that whispered sweet nothings.\nLet's talk food, shall we? I dove headfirst into the duck, and oh boy, the flavor was an absolute symphony! My girlfriend, meanwhile, was in pure bliss with her crab cake. Seriously, every bite was a testament to culinary artistry. And the drinks? Forget about it! They were so good, they practically danced on our tongues.\nNow, let's give a standing ovation to the service. Our waiter was a true maestro! Not only was he a wizard with the extensive whiskey, bourbon, and scotch selections, but he even concocted a custom cocktail for my girlfriend that was spot-on! Talk about going the extra mile!\nWe kicked things off with the calamari and beef short rib egg rolls ‚Äì a delightful duet of textures and tastes that set the stage for the main event. Yes, it's a tad on the pricier side, but trust me on this one, every single penny was an investment in an unforgettable experience.\nFast forward, and I've already played restaurant matchmaker, recommending Tonic to one of my best friends. Guess what? They were absolutely blown away and showered me with gratitude for the tip!\nSo, if you're looking for a top-notch dining experience in Wilmington, a place that nails the food, the drinks, the service, and sets the perfect romantic mood, then Tonic Seafood & Steak is your spot. Trust me, your taste buds (and your date!) will thank you. I'm already counting down the days until my next visit!",

          "text": "Alright, get ready for a review that'll make your mouth water and your fingers itch to make a reservation!\nListen up, fellow foodies and romance seekers! My recent expedition to Tonic Seafood & Steak in Wilmington was nothing short of spectacular. Picture this: a balmy evening, stars peeking out, and my amazing girlfriend by my side as we dined al fresco in an atmosphere that whispered sweet nothings.\nLet's talk food, shall we? I dove headfirst into the duck, and oh boy, the flavor was an absolute symphony! My girlfriend, meanwhile, was in pure bliss with her crab cake. Seriously, every bite was a testament to culinary artistry. And the drinks? Forget about it! They were so good, they practically danced on our tongues.\nNow, let's give a standing ovation to the service. Our waiter was a true maestro! Not only was he a wizard with the extensive whiskey, bourbon, and scotch selections, but he even concocted a custom cocktail for my girlfriend that was spot-on! Talk about going the extra mile!\nWe kicked things off with the calamari and beef short rib egg rolls ‚Äì a delightful duet of textures and tastes that set the stage for the main event. Yes, it's a tad on the pricier side, but trust me on this one, every single penny was an investment in an unforgettable experience.\nFast forward, and I've already played restaurant matchmaker, recommending Tonic to one of my best friends. Guess what? They were absolutely blown away and showered me with gratitude for the tip!\nSo, if you're looking for a top-notch dining experience in Wilmington, a place that nails the food, the drinks, the service, and sets the perfect romantic mood, then Tonic Seafood & Steak is your spot. Trust me, your taste buds (and your date!) will thank you. I'm already counting down the days until my next visit!",
