When we walked in, we waited for about 3-5 minutes before we were greeted in a pretty empty restaurant. Once greeted, we were seated promptly.\n\n2. The staff are clearly all in high school and young so they're inexperienced and a little slow but that's ok, they're learning and this is a small local business so we really don't have an issue but if speed is a big factor for you, then be aware.\n\nThe positives:\n\n1. Really affordable. The meals were all reasonably priced which is nice when feeding a family.\n\n2. We loved the chips and salsa. The chips were warm and tasted homemade with just the right amount of salt and we really enjoyed the salsa.\n\n3. The refried black beans were delicious and seemed to be homemade.\n\n4. We enjoyed our entrees but they did feel like they were on the smaller side, could've been bigger but still delicious.\n\n5. It's a local business that seems family owned and we love supporting that.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Cocolitos and I'll be back!",

I really liked their beans, and their chips. Servers are friendly and checked on us a good amount. The salsa was good but not my favorite, it needs a little extra spice, maybe more cilantro. There was no music playing and it was quiet so we didn‚Äôt want to talk at a normal volume. This place is definitely a more intimate vibe. Still would def recommend this place and will be back. Always a good idea to support a small local business!",

I do wish there was a little more of the filling. The wife had the large nachos, not the biggest we have seen but very adequate. The staff was very friendly and professional. Clean environment. They seem to share a bathroom with a couple other businesses but that was clean and everything functioned will. I would go back and try more of the menu.",

Oh my gosh, I haven't had Mexican food this good in awhile. And this was the best fried ice cream I've had at a restaurant. Typically I have to make my own to make sure it is seasoned enough.
