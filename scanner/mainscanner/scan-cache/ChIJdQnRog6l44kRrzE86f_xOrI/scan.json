          "text": "Had a menu that came to me in a pamphlet at the post delivers with the inserts of many other companies. I ordered the pizza and mentioned the coupon the three dollars off of anything $17.99, an employee named Mike gave me a hard time and accuse me of lying about the menu and even asked me to send him a text message with pictures in it. Reluctantly he gave in and completed the order and I gave a $5 tip for the delivery driver to have them put it on the credit card also. Total should have been about $23.99 or whatever.\nDisgruntled with the employee named Mike who gave me a lot of flack for 20 minutes arguing, I want to talk to the store owner named Hany.\nWhen I got there he \"appeared\" to be understanding said that his employees shouldn't have talked like that. I showed him the menu that I brought with me and he took it into his care and said for future reference this menu was not something we know about. Went home and the next day or two, noticed the credit card was charged $27.23.\nIn other words they never applied to coupon and I called the on her back and again for 20 minutes, tried to present the ethics of customer service to this guy and how $3 shouldn't I've been honored and the pizza delivered if there's something wrong with the communication or that I would agree or disagree with it, but they delivered it.\nI had my credit card company flagged their companies fraud so no more charges can be placed. Told the credit card company there should be 23.99, not 27.23.\nI'm perfectly happy to honor the charge of the $23.99 but not the overcharge price.",
