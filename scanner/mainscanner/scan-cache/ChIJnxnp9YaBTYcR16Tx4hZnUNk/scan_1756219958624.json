The person serving me at the bar was very nice and knew how to serve me while still keeping distance (I was at the bar because I went solo, not because I was drinking). The atmosphere and design was also great.\n\nDon't even get me started on the bread sticks! Those things were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and perfect in every way (as you can see, I couldn't help but start eating before taking a picture). They put the right amount of spice to where it tasted a little tangy but also very salty in compliment with the cheese.\n\nDefinitely coming back as often as I can!",

We went to eat tonight and the server we had last time remembered us and came up and said hello, then just as we were finishing our pizza and getting ready to order dessert, here came our favourite dessert!  Grace, one of the managers there always remembers us and sent our favourite dessert out before we even had a chance to order it!  It made us feel pretty good!

I love that everything also has a slight twist to it to make it unique, it really makes it stand out.\n\nGet the ambassador bridge. It's perfect. Lots of other things on the menu are good as well, but that's the best.\n\nThe staff here is so friendly and make good recommendations. It's very clean inside and has many different seating options (booths, tables, bar seating, outdoor area).\n\nCannot recommend this place enough!",

The crispy, cheesy crust, wrapped around the tastiest pizza with just the perfect amount of sauce, it‚Äôs absolutely mind blowing!!  The other thing I love is the staff!!  We went to eat tonight and the server we had last time remembered us and came up and said hello, then just as we were finishing our pizza and getting ready to order dessert, here came our favourite dessert!  Grace, one of the managers there always remembers us and sent our favourite dessert out before we even had a chance to order it!  It made us feel pretty good!  So if you want amazing pizza, drinks and desserts that will blow your mind, plus staff that treats you and feeds you like family,  is definitely the place to go.",

          "text": "Via 313 has great deep dish, Detroit-style pizza. My absolute favorite option is \"The Cadillac\", mostly because they can sometimes put on a little too much sauce and the Cadillac doesn't have tomato sauce on it. That being said, I have also enjoyed the other options I've gotten here a lot. They also have a great root beer option that comes in a frosted mug (our server told us we could get a free refill of another soda after it was gone, not sure if that's standard). Biggest downside for me is that the service can be a bit slow, especially with a group (I usually go with about 10 people in the group and it takes about an hour to get our food even though it's relatively empty during lunch time). The price is also a bit high for my tastes.",

The environment is awesome, the food is SO good, and there is a lot of choose from, including drinks. Our waiter, Parker, was an absolutely gem. He was attentive, respectful, and very outgoing. He made the experience for us! I suggest you come to this place, if not for the experience but for the food as well. Come on Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays if you want to be served by Parker. ;) If his boss sees this, give him a raise!",

I had placed a carry out order and sat in their carry out room for about 20 minutes while at least two employees walked past me without acknowledging me, despite me try to ask them for help.\n\nThen tonight we ordered for delivery. My order was supposed to be delivered at 6:33. By 653 after not hearing from the restaurant at all, I called. Got put on hold right away. Then I'm told \"Oh your dasher just got here.\" It should be there soon. No where on their website does it say they deliver via doordash. I've never had a good experience with doordash. And had I known they used them for delivery. I never would have ordered delivery. Now my pizza will arrive about 45 minutes after it should have. $80 worth of soggy pizza and cheese bread. Yay.\n\nI guess you can only eat in person at this location for a good experience.\n\n5 stars for food. 1 star for service. Poor service outweighs quality food.",

The food was very tasty We ordered a Detroit style Hawaiian pizza and a rocky road hubcap dessert.\n\nOur server, Parker, was exceptional - polite, respectful, and enthusiastic with recommendations when we asked. After he served us he didn‚Äôt disappear, but checked in on us throughout our meal. Completely unprompted, he asked if I liked the flavored lemonade because he noticed I wasn‚Äôt drinking it. I admitted that I liked it but that it was a little too strong for me. He made me a new more mild one so it would be more to my taste. I don‚Äôt think he treated us any differently than he treats all of his customers, I think he regularly goes above and beyond. If I could give 10/5 stars for service I would. If we‚Äôre ever in the area again, we‚Äôll be back.",

Sometimes larger groups of people can be hard to take care of and it can be stressful for the diners and the staff but that is not the case with Via. They made us feel so welcome and truly went above and beyond. If you are looking for delicious pizza, great service, and a nice atmosphere, don‚Äôt skip this place. Highly recommend. Major shoutout to Crystal in Lehi, you made our night!",

My order was supposed to be delivered at 6:33. By 653 after not hearing from the restaurant at all, I called. Got put on hold right away. Then I'm told \"Oh your dasher just got here.\" It should be there soon. No where on their website does it say they deliver via doordash. I've never had a good experience with doordash. And had I known they used them for delivery. I never would have ordered delivery. Now my pizza will arrive about 45 minutes after it should have. $80 worth of soggy pizza and cheese bread. Yay.\n\nI guess you can only eat in person at this location for a good experience.\n\n5 stars for food. 1 star for service. Poor service outweighs quality food.",
