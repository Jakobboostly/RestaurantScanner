The taste and the smell was so amazing! We pretty much ate the whole medium pizza because it was delicious! The only thing is I think they need cut their slices more evenly other that perfect! They have a happy customer and will always be coming back! They even have bar so you get off work need a quick bite to eat and beer then be on your way! Or just somewhere to chit chat with friends. When I pulled up to the pizza shop smelt someone smoking out side also which that smelt so good! They didn't care about them smoking cannabis which is a great thing! I want to thek for them supporting cannabis as well!",

The taste and the smell was so amazing! We pretty much ate the whole medium pizza because it was delicious! The only thing is I think they need cut their slices more evenly other that perfect! They have a happy customer and will always be coming back! They even have bar so you get off work need a quick bite to eat and beer then be on your way! Or just somewhere to chit chat with friends. When I pulled up to the pizza shop smelt someone smoking out side also which that smelt so good! They didn't care about them smoking cannabis which is a great thing! I want to thek for them supporting cannabis as well!",

The taste and the smell was so amazing! We pretty much ate the whole medium pizza because it was delicious! The only thing is I think they need cut their slices more evenly other that perfect! They have a happy customer and will always be coming back! They even have bar so you get off work need a quick bite to eat and beer then be on your way! Or just somewhere to chit chat with friends. When I pulled up to the pizza shop smelt someone smoking out side also which that smelt so good! They didn't care about them smoking cannabis which is a great thing! I want to thek for them supporting cannabis as well!",

So I got pepperoni on it. It was very tasty and hot! If I had more time I would have sat and had some beers. The bar looked cozy and comfortable. Thank you for the great service and food!
