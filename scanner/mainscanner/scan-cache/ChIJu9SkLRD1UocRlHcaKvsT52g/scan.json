I had some of the fries from my children's plate and that was alright. It was hard to hear the person behind the counter when I was ordering, and thats with barely any people in the place.

But today, I was so disgusted to discover my half and half bowl had some sort of yellow sauce all over it that tasted like curry. I looked on the menu and learned that the only thing it could be is mustard. YUCK! On top of the mustard as if to \"hide\" it was the actual sauce I ordered (creamy sriracha). SO that meant that not only did I get mustard on my bowl (eww) but it basically had double sauce on it. It was like a soup. Completely inedible. So gross!! Sad to say but I won't be ordering here again. To the staff if you mess something up I recommend simply remaking it instead of sending it to one of your loyal customers.",

I had the bowl (sound familiar? ) with rice, garbanzo beans, lamb beef kabob... plus pita, toppings and sauce.  Watching them use a caulking gun to squirt out the sauce was a bit unnerving...  Make it a combo and you get a side and drink. Plenty to eat and a nice alternative to a burger place. Customer operated soda machine takes a while to make a selection from many, many drink options and a line quickly forms. Most first time customers were a bit confused ordering as I was. If you don't know what it is or includes... ask. Menu on board is not very clear for new customers even if you have been to Greece.\nSeating could be more inviting like it is in Greece rather than a subway sandwich place. They do have limited outside seating for nice weather.\nCompetition across the street probably keeps them doing their best.\nGreek music playing was a novel idea.\nOverall good food and I would go back... after trying across the street just to see what that is all about and make another review üôÑ",

But today, I was so disgusted to discover my half and half bowl had some sort of yellow sauce all over it that tasted like curry. I looked on the menu and learned that the only thing it could be is mustard. YUCK! On top of the mustard as if to \"hide\" it was the actual sauce I ordered (creamy sriracha). SO that meant that not only did I get mustard on my bowl (eww) but it basically had double sauce on it. It was like a soup. Completely inedible. So gross!!

Also, after reading other peoples reviews im sure the only reason they got my order right was because i was actually inside the restraunt. Overall, id say i might go here again if i was in the area already, but since theres better greek restraunts in SLC it wouldnt be my first choice",

The pita bread was hard and stale. It was so bad I couldn't bare another bite. The lamb/beef meat was also hard and cold and flavorless. I had some of the fries from my children's plate and that was alright. It was hard to hear the person behind the counter when I was ordering, and thats with barely any people in the place.

But today, I was so disgusted to discover my half and half bowl had some sort of yellow sauce all over it that tasted like curry. I looked on the menu and learned that the only thing it could be is mustard. YUCK! On top of the mustard as if to \"hide\" it was the actual sauce I ordered (creamy sriracha). SO that meant that not only did I get mustard on my bowl (eww) but it basically had double sauce on it. It was like a soup. Completely inedible. So gross!! Sad to say but I won't be ordering here again. To the staff if you mess something up I recommend simply remaking it instead of sending it to one of your loyal customers.",

I had Padeli's cater three large lunches for me last week and the food was excellent, delivery was on time, and everything was included. The attendees of all three lunches asked where the food was from and exclaimed that it was great. When leaving town, I stopped by the restaurant to have lunch myself and to thank the staff for their efforts. I highly recommend Padeli's for dine-in, to go, and catering.",

For almost $30 meal for 2, I would expect at least a decent dish. To give prospect customers a comparison, Arby's gyro is definitely way better than Padeli's gyro in terms of taste and freshness.",

But today, I was so disgusted to discover my half and half bowl had some sort of yellow sauce all over it that tasted like curry. I looked on the menu and learned that the only thing it could be is mustard. YUCK! On top of the mustard as if to \"hide\" it was the actual sauce I ordered (creamy sriracha). SO that meant that not only did I get mustard on my bowl (eww) but it basically had double sauce on it. It was like a soup. Completely inedible. So gross!! Sad to say but I won't be ordering here again. To the staff if you mess something up I recommend simply remaking it instead of sending it to one of your loyal customers.",
