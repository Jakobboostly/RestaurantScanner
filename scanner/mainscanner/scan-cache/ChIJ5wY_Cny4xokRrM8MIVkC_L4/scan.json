I ordered the Eggplant Parmiciana/Parmigiana Sandwich (I should have walked out when I saw they mistakenly wrote ‚ÄúParmesan‚Äù on the menu tbh) and the Medium Cheese Pizza.\n\nThe food wasn‚Äôt seasoned, like at all. It didn‚Äôt even taste like they used salt in the pizza - a little bit in the dough at most. The pizza was also very undercooked but maybe they expect customers will finish cooking it in our home ovens so it can be freshly cooked at home. The fried eggplant tasted like other things that had been fried in the oil. They toasted the bread and fried the eggplant very well though, which were redeeming aspects of the meal.\n\nAlthough one other staff member greeted me at the door, the red haired man at the register seemed to have a discriminatory judgmental attitude when I asked a clarifying question about the menu. I didn‚Äôt see any slices listed on the menu so I thought maybe this was supposed to be an ironic pizzeria. I asked, laughing, if this is a place called ‚ÄúSlices‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt sell slices.\n\nHe gave a disjointed response, seemingly with an attitude, that they were almost closing so that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt have many slices out on display. I didn‚Äôt ask about that so it was a confusing response and I hadn‚Äôt even been past the register so I didn‚Äôt see that they had anything on display, and like I said I knew almost nothing about this place beforehand. It just seemed like he judged me based on how I look, unless he treats everyone this way. If he doesn‚Äôt treat everyone this way, why else did he single me out other than something that can be perceived visually? We had no prior interaction.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright lights and no decor.",

          "text": "I saw this place on the map and walked in off the street having seen some good reviews and never having been here. I ordered the Eggplant Parmiciana/Parmigiana Sandwich (I should have walked out when I saw they mistakenly wrote ‚ÄúParmesan‚Äù on the menu tbh) and the Medium Cheese Pizza.\n\nThe food wasn‚Äôt seasoned, like at all. It didn‚Äôt even taste like they used salt in the pizza - a little bit in the dough at most. The pizza was also very undercooked but maybe they expect customers will finish cooking it in our home ovens so it can be freshly cooked at home. The fried eggplant tasted like other things that had been fried in the oil. They toasted the bread and fried the eggplant very well though, which were redeeming aspects of the meal.\n\nAlthough one other staff member greeted me at the door, the red haired man at the register seemed to have a discriminatory judgmental attitude when I asked a clarifying question about the menu. I didn‚Äôt see any slices listed on the menu so I thought maybe this was supposed to be an ironic pizzeria. I asked, laughing, if this is a place called ‚ÄúSlices‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt sell slices.\n\nHe gave a disjointed response, seemingly with an attitude, that they were almost closing so that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt have many slices out on display. I didn‚Äôt ask about that so it was a confusing response and I hadn‚Äôt even been past the register so I didn‚Äôt see that they had anything on display, and like I said I knew almost nothing about this place beforehand. It just seemed like he judged me based on how I look, unless he treats everyone this way. If he doesn‚Äôt treat everyone this way, why else did he single me out other than something that can be perceived visually? We had no prior interaction.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright lights and no decor.",

And the Cesar Salad with chicken and a variety of crutons is so good, too. They have slices of pizza always ready for purchase, and you get a slice magnet. Once you fill a pizza with slice magnets, you get a free pizza!\n\nThe employees are so nice and try to accommodate your interests and help you decide on the menu.\n\nThey have a different small business drop-off desserts, which include a cheesecake, chocolate cake, and oreo cheesecake.\n\nThey have pepsi beverages in bottles for purchase. Inside has seating for probably 12 people. And there is a TV inside too. It's a small place, so most get their items to go. You can order ahead online with their easy to use website.\n\nI moved into the apartments down the road, so I will be back. And to take photos of my food because I was in a hurry last visit.",

We absolutely love it! Their other, more traditional pizza varieties are great as well, as are the side orders. Their garlic knots are fantastic! Slices (in East Falls) delivers to a fairly wide range of areas; delivery typically takes 25 to 45 minutes depending on how busy they are.\nAn added bonus is their refrigerator magnet collection program. Every order comes with a magnet shaped like a slice of pizza, and when you've collected 8 of them (to form a full pizza shape), you can redeem them for a free large pizza.\nIf you sign up online, you'll also receive weekly coupons via text message (if you opt to).\nI would highly recommend Slices to anyone in the mood for good pizza and/or other casual fare.",

I wish more transparency about this issue was offered and I am upset because I do want to support this business.

The crust was horrible it tasted like cardboard the vegetable toppings were cut wrong and raw .They definitely need to learn from successful pizza places how to build and flavor a proper pizza if they are going to ask for this price. The only thing at this point I would recommend from Slices is the steak hoagies and the cold hoagies which which are pretty good you don't feel like your being ripped off like the nasty pizza. Slices  needs to hire  people who put love in and know how to make a serious pie with the name  Slices so people who know how a pie is supposed to  taste wouldn't  be so disappointed .I'm still upset at the crappie pizza they sold me they need to go back to school and learn pizza 101 .",

I ordered the Eggplant Parmiciana/Parmigiana Sandwich (I should have walked out when I saw they mistakenly wrote ‚ÄúParmesan‚Äù on the menu tbh) and the Medium Cheese Pizza.\n\nThe food wasn‚Äôt seasoned, like at all. It didn‚Äôt even taste like they used salt in the pizza - a little bit in the dough at most. The pizza was also very undercooked but maybe they expect customers will finish cooking it in our home ovens so it can be freshly cooked at home. The fried eggplant tasted like other things that had been fried in the oil. They toasted the bread and fried the eggplant very well though, which were redeeming aspects of the meal.\n\nAlthough one other staff member greeted me at the door, the red haired man at the register seemed to have a discriminatory judgmental attitude when I asked a clarifying question about the menu. I didn‚Äôt see any slices listed on the menu so I thought maybe this was supposed to be an ironic pizzeria. I asked, laughing, if this is a place called ‚ÄúSlices‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt sell slices.\n\nHe gave a disjointed response, seemingly with an attitude, that they were almost closing so that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt have many slices out on display. I didn‚Äôt ask about that so it was a confusing response and I hadn‚Äôt even been past the register so I didn‚Äôt see that they had anything on display, and like I said I knew almost nothing about this place beforehand. It just seemed like he judged me based on how I look, unless he treats everyone this way. If he doesn‚Äôt treat everyone this way, why else did he single me out other than something that can be perceived visually? We had no prior interaction.\n\nThe atmosphere is bright lights and no decor.",

The wings tasted stale and old with no seasoning, my pizza was dry and tasteless.\nMy food didn‚Äôt stay down for 10 minutes my stomach is so upset. This is the 2nd time this has happened. Not sure what‚Äôs going on, but I probably won‚Äôt be ordering anything again.\n\nDo better, wash your hands, change your gloves, clean your utensils. Actually put some care and effort into what you‚Äôre doing.",
