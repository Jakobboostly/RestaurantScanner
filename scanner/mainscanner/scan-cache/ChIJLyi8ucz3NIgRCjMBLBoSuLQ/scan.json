          "text": "Raya's Pizza\n\nGOOD: Solid neighborhood business.  The pizza, wings and hoagie were very good.\n\nBAD:  Overpriced condiments and messy take out prep - no impact on food quality.\n\nRaya's was a nice surprise.  As an out of town visiter (born and raised near philly) I am picky with pizza quality.\n\nRaya's delivered, the first thing that stands out is a perfect, stiff crust.  The sauce is very flavorful.  A pinch more salt in the cheese - then solid A.  The wings are tender, juicy and the garlic parm sauce was very good.  The Gyro hoagie had tasty meat and feta.  The toasted roll was great.\n\nI had to knock 1 star on a collection of things.  The sauces for 1.50 - customers expect a dip with wings.  At 1.50 it feels more like a premium pizza topping and I can buy a small bottle of ranch for 1.99.  Include one sauce and raise your price 25 cents?\n\nMessy prep for take out - all the food was delicious, but the wing sauce got everywhere.  It leaked right though tissue paper, the box AND the bag.  Line the boxes with foil - big savor.\n\nThe hoagie tasted great, but rather than a total slice through, creating two halves (where toppings fall out hard core)  deep slice the side and stuff the roll.  It acts to hold the toppings - Eastern PA Wawa trick.\n\nI would definitely order from Raya's again, either way.",

The dough was very much bread like, no significant chew or crunch. (it was delivery, so not deducting a lot for that!) Sauce was too sweet for our taste. Got extra cheese and pepperoni, neither was too generous. Maybe we'll try the thin crust sometime, but that sauce makes me doubt it'd be worth it.",

          "text": "Ordered a door dash Sicilian pizza because this place has been there forever, so thought we should give it a try. It was just passable. The dough was very much bread like, no significant chew or crunch. (it was delivery, so not deducting a lot for that!) Sauce was too sweet for our taste. Got extra cheese and pepperoni, neither was too generous. Maybe we'll try the thin crust sometime, but that sauce makes me doubt it'd be worth it.",

          "text": "Raya's Pizza\n\nGOOD: Solid neighborhood business.  The pizza, wings and hoagie were very good.\n\nBAD:  Overpriced condiments and messy take out prep - no impact on food quality.\n\nRaya's was a nice surprise.  As an out of town visiter (born and raised near philly) I am picky with pizza quality.\n\nRaya's delivered, the first thing that stands out is a perfect, stiff crust.  The sauce is very flavorful.  A pinch more salt in the cheese - then solid A.  The wings are tender, juicy and the garlic parm sauce was very good.  The Gyro hoagie had tasty meat and feta.  The toasted roll was great.\n\nI had to knock 1 star on a collection of things.  The sauces for 1.50 - customers expect a dip with wings.  At 1.50 it feels more like a premium pizza topping and I can buy a small bottle of ranch for 1.99.  Include one sauce and raise your price 25 cents?\n\nMessy prep for take out - all the food was delicious, but the wing sauce got everywhere.  It leaked right though tissue paper, the box AND the bag.  Line the boxes with foil - big savor.\n\nThe hoagie tasted great, but rather than a total slice through, creating two halves (where toppings fall out hard core)  deep slice the side and stuff the roll.  It acts to hold the toppings - Eastern PA Wawa trick.\n\nI would definitely order from Raya's again, either way.",

The pizza, wings and hoagie were very good.\n\nBAD:  Overpriced condiments and messy take out prep - no impact on food quality.\n\nRaya's was a nice surprise.  As an out of town visiter (born and raised near philly) I am picky with pizza quality.\n\nRaya's delivered, the first thing that stands out is a perfect, stiff crust.  The sauce is very flavorful.  A pinch more salt in the cheese - then solid A.  The wings are tender, juicy and the garlic parm sauce was very good.  The Gyro hoagie had tasty meat and feta.  The toasted roll was great.\n\nI had to knock 1 star on a collection of things.  The sauces for 1.50 - customers expect a dip with wings.  At 1.50 it feels more like a premium pizza topping and I can buy a small bottle of ranch for 1.99.  Include one sauce and raise your price 25 cents?\n\nMessy prep for take out - all the food was delicious, but the wing sauce got everywhere.  It leaked right though tissue paper, the box AND the bag.  Line the boxes with foil - big savor.\n\nThe hoagie tasted great, but rather than a total slice through, creating two halves (where toppings fall out hard core)  deep slice the side and stuff the roll.  It acts to hold the toppings - Eastern PA Wawa trick.\n\nI would definitely order from Raya's again, either way.",
