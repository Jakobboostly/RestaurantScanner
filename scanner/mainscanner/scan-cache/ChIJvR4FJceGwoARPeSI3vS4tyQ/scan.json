The toppings are fresh and flavorful.\n\nOn a humorous note, we ordered an extra large pizza last week and before we placed the order, we were asked if we were sure we knew how big it was. We were and we proceeded with paying for the pizza. When my husband brought it home, it barely fit through our door. No, that is not an exaggeration. So if you're looking for a super large pizza to feed a small army, consider the Vincenzo's extra large.",

We were and we proceeded with paying for the pizza. When my husband brought it home, it barely fit through our door. No, that is not an exaggeration.

The toppings are fresh and flavorful.\n\nOn a humorous note, we ordered an extra large pizza last week and before we placed the order, we were asked if we were sure we knew how big it was. We were and we proceeded with paying for the pizza. When my husband brought it home, it barely fit through our door. No, that is not an exaggeration. So if you're looking for a super large pizza to feed a small army, consider the Vincenzo's extra large.",

The BBQ chicken wings is good, not too sweet. My only concern is their pepperoni topping, it‚Äôs very very salty for my taste, not good for people on a low-salt diet or with high blood pressure ü§£ Overall though, I still like Vincenzo‚Äôs and maybe avoid the pepperoni next time.",

We're always looking for great NY Style pizza and they can stretch a pie thin to sort of kind of get you in that direction.\n\nYou order at the counter (which may be hard to find if you've never been there before...you have to enter the dining room, walk through it, take a couple of lefts before you get there.) Then they bring your food to the table.\n\nWe ordered a medium cheese stretched thin...there's always a risk that pizza places don't put enough sauce on a pie...we really like to taste the sauce...I asked about this and they said they'd put a little extra on ours. What came to the table didn't have much sauce on it and was slightly overcooked. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't really achieve the NYC style pie we were looking for.\n\nThe Cheese Garlic Bread was good...served on Texas-Style toast. We also had a green salad which had lots of croutons and some cheese on it...basic but good enough.\n\nI think we're still pining for excellent NY style pizza up here. Vincenzo's wasn't quite it. It's nice that they'll stretch their pies thin...the overall dated atmosphere of the room and the many years the place has been there left us thinking this place may have had a hey-day which it left behind a while ago.",

I was picking up my order and a weirdo rude older man tried to thrust his receipt in front of me while I was *midsentence* with the guy behind the counter. Without missing a beat, he gracefully told the guy to wait his turn. Then when I was done, he made sure to ask \"who's next\" because the guy behind me was also about to be cut in line by the rude weirdo. Perfectly smooth, no drama maneuver. Anyway, this is a *very* specific anecdote which I hope captures the essence of my five-star service rating.\n\nPizza is always a solid choice with lots of other good contenders in town. The ambiance of the restaurant hasn't changed much over the years-- great for casual get-togethers / group meals. Nothing fancy but a very comfortable sort of nothing fancy!",

The toppings are fresh and flavorful.\n\nOn a humorous note, we ordered an extra large pizza last week and before we placed the order, we were asked if we were sure we knew how big it was. We were and we proceeded with paying for the pizza. When my husband brought it home, it barely fit through our door. No, that is not an exaggeration. So if you're looking for a super large pizza to feed a small army, consider the Vincenzo's extra large.",

We're always looking for great NY Style pizza and they can stretch a pie thin to sort of kind of get you in that direction.\n\nYou order at the counter (which may be hard to find if you've never been there before...you have to enter the dining room, walk through it, take a couple of lefts before you get there.) Then they bring your food to the table.\n\nWe ordered a medium cheese stretched thin...there's always a risk that pizza places don't put enough sauce on a pie...we really like to taste the sauce...I asked about this and they said they'd put a little extra on ours. What came to the table didn't have much sauce on it and was slightly overcooked. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't really achieve the NYC style pie we were looking for.\n\nThe Cheese Garlic Bread was good...served on Texas-Style toast. We also had a green salad which had lots of croutons and some cheese on it...basic but good enough.\n\nI think we're still pining for excellent NY style pizza up here. Vincenzo's wasn't quite it. It's nice that they'll stretch their pies thin...the overall dated atmosphere of the room and the many years the place has been there left us thinking this place may have had a hey-day which it left behind a while ago.",
