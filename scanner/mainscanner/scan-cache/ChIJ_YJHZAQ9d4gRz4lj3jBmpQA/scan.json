          "text": "Arrived shortly before noon on a Friday. The atmosphere is an open friendly pizza restaurant. One of those that you can hang out and enjoy your pizza. Service was excellent, even with it being during lunch hours. Employees were courteous and efficient.  The food was amazing and I enjoyed the new flavors that made the pizza taste so much better. The sauce and fresh ingredients are a part of what makes up the new flavors. They are very generous with their toppings which makes a well made pizza with ratio to crust, sauce and toppings. Had both thin crust and hand tossed pizzas cooked to perfection. I also ordered an Italian salad that was full of toppings and flavor. This isn't a huge amount of lettuce with a few toppings sprinkled on top, the toppings are a part of the salad and can be tasted in every bite.\n\nOverall the best pizza experience in a very long time.",

          "text": "I had a bad experience here that easily could have been avoided. My buddies and I came in around 6:00 on a Saturday wanting to dine in. They have plenty of tables available for dining in but no wait staff, so we ordered at the counter. We got a Chicago-style deep dish, cheese sticks, and boneless wings. Then we got our drinks and sat at the table. I knew Chicago-style usually takes awhile, so we were waiting patiently. There was one other group dining in and they arrived after us and hadn't received their food yet either, so we kept waiting. After 50 minutes, I went to the counter to tell them that we'd take the wings and cheese sticks first if they were ready to go. Turns out, everything had been ready awhile and it was just sitting on the back shelf for who knows how long. Yes, we were sitting there for 50 minutes and the entire staff who could see us through the ordering window never once thought to bring us our food. Totally unacceptable.\n\nSince it was all packaged to go (even though we had intended to eat there), we left and ate it at home. It tasted great, which was a big bummer that it was cold. The boneless wings would have been better if they were sauced instead of just being served as chicken nuggets with a side of dipping sauce.\n\nOverall, this place has great potential if they can get their customer service corrected.",

Service was excellent, even with it being during lunch hours. Employees were courteous and efficient.  The food was amazing and I enjoyed the new flavors that made the pizza taste so much better. The sauce and fresh ingredients are a part of what makes up the new flavors. They are very generous with their toppings which makes a well made pizza with ratio to crust, sauce and toppings. Had both thin crust and hand tossed pizzas cooked to perfection. I also ordered an Italian salad that was full of toppings and flavor. This isn't a huge amount of lettuce with a few toppings sprinkled on top, the toppings are a part of the salad and can be tasted in every bite.\n\nOverall the best pizza experience in a very long time.",

They have plenty of tables available for dining in but no wait staff, so we ordered at the counter. We got a Chicago-style deep dish, cheese sticks, and boneless wings. Then we got our drinks and sat at the table. I knew Chicago-style usually takes awhile, so we were waiting patiently. There was one other group dining in and they arrived after us and hadn't received their food yet either, so we kept waiting. After 50 minutes, I went to the counter to tell them that we'd take the wings and cheese sticks first if they were ready to go. Turns out, everything had been ready awhile and it was just sitting on the back shelf for who knows how long. Yes, we were sitting there for 50 minutes and the entire staff who could see us through the ordering window never once thought to bring us our food. Totally unacceptable.\n\nSince it was all packaged to go (even though we had intended to eat there), we left and ate it at home. It tasted great, which was a big bummer that it was cold. The boneless wings would have been better if they were sauced instead of just being served as chicken nuggets with a side of dipping sauce.\n\nOverall, this place has great potential if they can get their customer service corrected.",

Service was excellent, even with it being during lunch hours. Employees were courteous and efficient.  The food was amazing and I enjoyed the new flavors that made the pizza taste so much better. The sauce and fresh ingredients are a part of what makes up the new flavors. They are very generous with their toppings which makes a well made pizza with ratio to crust, sauce and toppings. Had both thin crust and hand tossed pizzas cooked to perfection. I also ordered an Italian salad that was full of toppings and flavor. This isn't a huge amount of lettuce with a few toppings sprinkled on top, the toppings are a part of the salad and can be tasted in every bite.\n\nOverall the best pizza experience in a very long time.",

            "text": "I had a bad experience here that easily could have been avoided. My buddies and I came in around 6:00 on a Saturday wanting to dine in. They have plenty of tables available for dining in but no wait staff, so we ordered at the counter. We got a Chicago-style deep dish, cheese sticks, and boneless wings. Then we got our drinks and sat at the table. I knew Chicago-style usually takes awhile, so we were waiting patiently. There was one other group dining in and they arrived after us and hadn't received their food yet either, so we kept waiting. After 50 minutes, I went to the counter to tell them that we'd take the wings and cheese sticks first if they were ready to go. Turns out, everything had been ready awhile and it was just sitting on the back shelf for who knows how long. Yes, we were sitting there for 50 minutes and the entire staff who could see us through the ordering window never once thought to bring us our food. Totally unacceptable.\n\nSince it was all packaged to go (even though we had intended to eat there), we left and ate it at home. It tasted great, which was a big bummer that it was cold. The boneless wings would have been better if they were sauced instead of just being served as chicken nuggets with a side of dipping sauce.\n\nOverall, this place has great potential if they can get their customer service corrected.",
