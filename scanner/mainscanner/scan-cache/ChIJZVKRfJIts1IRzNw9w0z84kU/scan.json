Plus, it was big enough to fold, which is my go-to pizza eating method. Also, the staff was really friendly and helpful. I will definitely be coming back soon! Bravo!",

Each one is hand-tossed with a great dough that‚Äôs wonderfully chewy and holds up everything. The sauce is super fresh, with a nice spice (flavor, not heat). It‚Äôs topped with tasty cheese and then whatever toppings you choose. I went with The Meats, which is sausage, pepperoni, bacon, sliced chicken served on hand-tossed dough with their original sauce. It‚Äôs absolutely killer.\n\nThe staff are really great. I arrived as one was dealing with a DoorDash issue. Though it wasn‚Äôt their fault, I could hear he was going above and beyond to help the customer get things made right. Providing the support number and telling them he‚Äôd be following up too. He didn‚Äôt have to but he did everything he could to make things right. He took the time to acknowledge me while helping the person on the phone and apologized (no need to) for not being with me sooner. Served my pie up with a smile and a genuine thank you for ordering.\n\nSlice is really special. Not only is it wonderful pizza (well, it is) but also great folks who care about people and product.\n\nCheck out Slice in NE Minneapolis. Amazing pizza and people.",

Only if you insist, do they then sell you the slice but they make you wait. And it seems the wait times are arbitrary. I've had an employee tell me it's a 7 minute wait to get a supreme slice, and I've had the other employee tell me it's a 25 minute wait. In both cases, I was the only customer whether IRL or online. I could tell I was the only customer, because as I was walking up to the shop in both instances the employee wasn't actively making pizzas, he was on his phone sitting down. Also they have a phone number, and the answering machine gives you the option to speak with an employee directly. But idk why they give you that option, considering the employees will purposefully ignore the calls. I've tried calling ahead over a dozen different times to check if they can sell me a slice without waiting and over a dozen times I've never had my call answered. I have even called and selected option 4 to speak with an employee while in front of the store waiting on my food, and witnessed the employee proceed to ignore and not pick up the ringing phone...\nso yeah it seems like both employees will do anything in their power to do as little work as possible. which is a shame because the pizza is the best pizza in NE mpls. if the owner(s) of slice bros cared more about their employees' work ethic this restaurant could become the best pizza place in the entire twin cities.",

          "text": "Ordered a pepperoni slice to try first. Crust was thin and crunched with each bite as a ny style pizza should. It was scalding hot and I had to wait several minutes before eating it. Cheese was good and I'm pretty sure whole milk mozzarella, opposed to skim. Sauce was light ,again the pizza places I frequently went in my were the same. Pepperoni was thin and I'd prefer a thick cut to hold up better in cooking , it was tasty though. The grease level was medium to high which is like most ny pizzas. I decided to go for a build your own with chicken and bacon to bring home. Sorry no pictures of that as it was gobbled up fast. Build your own signage says 18\" but as other reviews have said it is now 16\" and the ordering tablet says this. If you can spend more ( think almost double) go to Broders about 20 minutes away. I do think Slice is a good knock off ny slice and the price is fair for the ample portion. Parking is room for 1 car if it is free. There is street parking across from the place but limited as well . If someone in your group goes to brasa you can run over from parking there.",

Only if you insist, do they then sell you the slice but they make you wait. And it seems the wait times are arbitrary. I've had an employee tell me it's a 7 minute wait to get a supreme slice, and I've had the other employee tell me it's a 25 minute wait. In both cases, I was the only customer whether IRL or online. I could tell I was the only customer, because as I was walking up to the shop in both instances the employee wasn't actively making pizzas, he was on his phone sitting down. Also they have a phone number, and the answering machine gives you the option to speak with an employee directly. But idk why they give you that option, considering the employees will purposefully ignore the calls. I've tried calling ahead over a dozen different times to check if they can sell me a slice without waiting and over a dozen times I've never had my call answered. I have even called and selected option 4 to speak with an employee while in front of the store waiting on my food, and witnessed the employee proceed to ignore and not pick up the ringing phone...\nso yeah it seems like both employees will do anything in their power to do as little work as possible. which is a shame because the pizza is the best pizza in NE mpls. if the owner(s) of slice bros cared more about their employees' work ethic this restaurant could become the best pizza place in the entire twin cities.",
