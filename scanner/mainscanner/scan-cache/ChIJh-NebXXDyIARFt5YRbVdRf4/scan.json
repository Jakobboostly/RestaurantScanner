Love the Evel Knievel theme throughout the dining area and the artsy feel inside with all the slap stickers flooding every wall and blank space.\nThey have a cool bar, small indoor dining area and a small outdoor patio area.\nGreat customer service and good drinks. But the food is what brings the entire experience together.  The wings are delicious, meaty, and done well. Love the garlic knots with marinaraüëåüèª and the Caesar salad was good too.\nI look forward to coming back and trying their pizza next üëçüèª",

You can custom order pizzas and they do take about 20 minutes to 40 minutes. Depends on how busy they are but it‚Äôs well worth it. The gluten-free option is absolutely amazing. One of my friends is gluten-free one of the best pizzas he‚Äôs ever eaten!  The traditional buffalo wings are non-breaded and great sauce. Step off the strip and have an affordable meal with all of the excellent service and awesome ambience!",

Our group ordered a mix of vegan, vegetarian, and meat pizzas‚Äîsomething for everyone.\n\nThe standout for me was the vegan jalape√±o cilantro ranch‚Äîseriously, I could drink that stuff. So good! The vegan pepperoni pizza was a solid option, not the best I‚Äôve had, but still tasty and appreciated. I‚Äôm always happy to see vegan options on the menu.\n\nMy husband loved the cheese pizza, and the rest of our group gave a big thumbs-up to the regular pepperoni. The wait wasn‚Äôt bad considering how busy they were, but just a heads-up‚Äîit gets really loud inside. It was a bit overstimulating for our daughter, so if you‚Äôre visiting with kids, you might prefer taking it to go.\n\nOverall, we give Evil Pie a solid 4/5. Fun vibe, good pizza, and worth checking out when in Vegas!",

This funky pizza joint/bar has a super chill vibe, great music, and a cool, down-to-earth staff that makes the whole experience feel laid-back and fun.\n\nI ordered a slice of the chicken and ranch pizza and another one (wish I could remember what it was‚Äîprobably too busy enjoying it!), and let me tell you, these slices are HUGE. Like, one slice could easily take up a whole small pizza box. At about $6.25 a slice, you‚Äôre definitely getting your money‚Äôs worth‚Äîand then some.\n\nThe pizza itself? Insanely delicious. Crispy on the edges, cheesy in the middle, and full of bold, creative flavors. Honestly, it might just be the best slice I‚Äôve had in a very long time‚Äîhands down better than any slice I‚Äôve had before.\n\nThey call your name over the microphone when your order‚Äôs ready, which just adds to the fun and casual vibe. Whether you‚Äôre just grabbing a quick bite or hanging out for a drink, Evel Pie delivers on taste, size, and good energy. Highly recommend! Don‚Äôt forget this place is on Fremont Street as well.",

Love the Evel Knievel theme throughout the dining area and the artsy feel inside with all the slap stickers flooding every wall and blank space.\nThey have a cool bar, small indoor dining area and a small outdoor patio area.\nGreat customer service and good drinks. But the food is what brings the entire experience together.  The wings are delicious, meaty, and done well. Love the garlic knots with marinaraüëåüèª and the Caesar salad was good too.\nI look forward to coming back and trying their pizza next üëçüèª",

This funky pizza joint/bar has a super chill vibe, great music, and a cool, down-to-earth staff that makes the whole experience feel laid-back and fun.\n\nI ordered a slice of the chicken and ranch pizza and another one (wish I could remember what it was‚Äîprobably too busy enjoying it!), and let me tell you, these slices are HUGE. Like, one slice could easily take up a whole small pizza box. At about $6.25 a slice, you‚Äôre definitely getting your money‚Äôs worth‚Äîand then some.\n\nThe pizza itself? Insanely delicious. Crispy on the edges, cheesy in the middle, and full of bold, creative flavors. Honestly, it might just be the best slice I‚Äôve had in a very long time‚Äîhands down better than any slice I‚Äôve had before.\n\nThey call your name over the microphone when your order‚Äôs ready, which just adds to the fun and casual vibe. Whether you‚Äôre just grabbing a quick bite or hanging out for a drink, Evel Pie delivers on taste, size, and good energy. Highly recommend! Don‚Äôt forget this place is on Fremont Street as well.",

The vegan pepperoni pizza was a solid option, not the best I‚Äôve had, but still tasty and appreciated. I‚Äôm always happy to see vegan options on the menu.\n\nMy husband loved the cheese pizza, and the rest of our group gave a big thumbs-up to the regular pepperoni.
