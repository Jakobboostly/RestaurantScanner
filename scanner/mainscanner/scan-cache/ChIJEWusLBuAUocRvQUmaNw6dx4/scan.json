I really loved how much Chase brought his special sauce all over my beautiful 16 inch slices. And though Briggs is ONLY a sophomore, he still had a lot to do with the beautiful kaleidoscope of color that just filled me from my stomach to my mouth, all through my throat and everything. I would submit to the workers at Summit Pizza & Co. I WILL be back for extra meaty and delectable Italian meat and maybe some pizza too. From the peacefully free plains of California all the way to the pizza shops in downtown New York, I have never felt such passion (and from the inside of a box ? WOW !!!!). It‚Äôs been quite the panoply of loveliness today with my experience at Summit Pizza, and I WILL be back. It‚Äôs as if I could taste your personal philosophies in nothing more than dough, cheese, and what tasted like BUCKETS of extra special sauce. I love you guys. Keep pleasuring my insides and tastes with such culinary artworks.",

My wife grabbed about six Parmesan cheese packets‚Äînothing excessive for two pizzas‚Äîand the tall, lengthy kid with black hair at the counter immediately decided that was ‚Äúfar too many.‚Äù\n\nInstead of providing good customer service, he condescendingly told us he had worked there for two years and that ‚Äúpeople always grab way too many.‚Äù My wife politely reassured him, saying, ‚ÄúWe will use them all. Trust us.‚Äù But rather than letting paying customers take what they needed, he doubled down, rudely insisting, ‚ÄúNo, you won‚Äôt. Put some back.‚Äù\n\nExcuse me? Since when does a restaurant employee get to micromanage how much Parmesan a customer takes? If the restaurant has a policy, there‚Äôs a professional way to communicate it‚Äînot by embarrassing and arguing with a paying customer. This was not only unnecessary but incredibly rude.\n\nCustomer service 101: The customer isn‚Äôt always right, but in situations like this, you absolutely let it go. You don‚Äôt create an awkward, uncomfortable experience over something as insignificant as cheese packets. It‚Äôs a level of pettiness and unprofessionalism I wouldn‚Äôt expect from a place that presumably wants return customers.\n\nThe food was fine, but the experience left such a bad taste in our mouths that we won‚Äôt be returning. Plenty of other pizza places in town that actually value their customers‚ÄîSummit Pizza Co. clearly isn‚Äôt one of them.",

And though Briggs is ONLY a sophomore, he still had a lot to do with the beautiful kaleidoscope of color that just filled me from my stomach to my mouth, all through my throat and everything. I would submit to the workers at Summit Pizza & Co. I WILL be back for extra meaty and delectable Italian meat and maybe some pizza too. From the peacefully free plains of California all the way to the pizza shops in downtown New York, I have never felt such passion (and from the inside of a box ? WOW !!!!). It‚Äôs been quite the panoply of loveliness today with my experience at Summit Pizza, and I WILL be back.
