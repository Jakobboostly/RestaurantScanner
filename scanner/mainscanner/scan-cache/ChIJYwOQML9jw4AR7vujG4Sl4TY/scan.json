It didn't even have a crust it looked like just the inside of pizza that the kids only eat . I was definitely disappointed cuz it's pricey.  I expect better.   The customer service is good the staff is very kind . I don't blame them . Perhaps the owners fault .",

She was just looking like she was sleeping. Unfortunately, I'd have to say that I can get a Costco. Pizza for 10 bucks full of flavor and very large. I got theirs full of flavor cost me 30. A little smaller than Costco, I'd have to say that at the end of the day from between the 2I take the Costco app. It's just unfortunate that mom and pop places just can't. Can't You can't just can't do it. They just can't do it.Unfortunately, so I wish him all the well and I helped them all the best.But uh, for me, I'd probably never go back again",

They no longer make it the bread in house . They give a stale store bought hoggi roll . The pizza I got was plain  cheese thin crust . It was a pre made crust and tasted like a cracker . It didn't even have a crust it looked like just the inside of pizza that the kids only eat . I was definitely disappointed cuz it's pricey.  I expect better.   The customer service is good the staff is very kind . I don't blame them . Perhaps the owners fault .",
