The light cheese wouldn't be an issue on an excellent pizza but the sauce and crust were just basic.\n\nPasta noodles were cooked perfectly and sausage had a nice flavor, but the peas were undercooked (I love Al dente veggies, but they were nearly raw).\n\nWe live blocks away so will give them another try in hopes it was just bad luck.",

We tried the Tortiglioni Rosa & Margherita Pizza, which were decent, but nothing special.\n\nThe slices with fresh tomato & cheese were good, but the center of the pizza crust was pretty soggy. The light cheese wouldn't be an issue on an excellent pizza but the sauce and crust were just basic.\n\nPasta noodles were cooked perfectly and sausage had a nice flavor, but the peas were undercooked (I love Al dente veggies, but they were nearly raw).\n\nWe live blocks away so will give them another try in hopes it was just bad luck.",

The sandwich was very tasty, the meatballs tasted homemade with a fair portion of mozzarella and tomato sauce. The salad was fresh and  tasty. I scored my dish a 5 for taste and a 4 for portion size. The facility is well decorated and big enough to host a big party. There is a small variety of beers and I assume a full bar. I did not try any deserts .",
