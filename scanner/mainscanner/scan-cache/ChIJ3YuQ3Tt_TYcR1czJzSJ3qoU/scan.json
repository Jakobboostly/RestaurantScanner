It was not fully cooked and seemed like I was eating bird seed.\n\nThe toppings helped mask it slightly. I got the chicken, bacon, ranch pizza.\n\nThe regular pizza I am assuming is a lot better but they really need to improve on their gluten free crust!! Maybe their cauliflower one is better.\n\nThe gluten free pizza also takes so much longer (which I get) but maybe also inform customers of that. I had almost all 5-6 people after me get their pizza before mine even came out.",

The pizza was absolutely delicious authentic crust, fresh ingredients, and just the right balance of flavors. You can tell they take pride in what they serve.\n\nWhat really stood out was the staff. Everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming. From the moment I walked in, they made me feel like a regular. Great service, fast turnaround, and they even checked in to make sure everything was perfect.\n\nWe ordered the ‚ÄúDefinitely Authentic‚Äù Italiano with a balsamic glaze and pesto swirl. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for great pizza and genuinely kind people. Will definitely be coming back!",

The staff is super friendly and helped us make our pizza choices. It was right to listen to them.\n\nThe chicken bacon ranch and \"definitely authentic\" Italiano are outstanding. The bacon, chicken, tomato pieces are thick cut. They don't skip out on the ingredients, sauce, and the quality/freshness of it. They even have some homemade BBQ and jalapeno cilantro they can give on the side. We both really liked the Italiano pizza considering the flavor and the amount of arugula they put on because we asked!\n\nWe're so glad we came! This local Place Pizza has got some good wood fire pizzas without miles to travel to. Comparable to some wood fire pizza places in SLC. These pizzas are fired perfectly. The crusts aren't burnt like some other places do. They are not as greasy or heavy either.\n\nGreat first time experience. It isn't busy here at 5.30pm on a Saturday but 6pm it starts to fill up. And from observation they are so good at updating diners/takeout orders on the waiting time.",

They let us come in before hand and taste the pizza and showed us pictures of their setup.  The pizza was really good and the setup potential was promising.  Then at our venue the pizza was mid at best and really flimsy.  Then the setup was not what we were promised and looked really rushed.  Not impressed.",

          "text": "We‚Äôve been there a couple times and the pizza is great, but it feels like I‚Äôm in a college dorm that happens to have 2 nice pizza ovens in it. Atmosphere is EXREMELY cluttered and not enticing. Whenever we go to dine in, it‚Äôs crowded and the seating isn‚Äôt great. We are lucky if we find a spot to sit with our family. Last time there was an extra fold up table that my kids could move which isn‚Äôt fun for anyone who has kids. It‚Äôs also VERY hot inside during the summer due to the heat of the sun combined with the open pizza ovens. Again, pizza is great, but not a fun place to dine in. A nice re-design/remodel and extra AC would really make this place ‚ÄúThe Place‚Äù",

The staff is super friendly and helped us make our pizza choices. It was right to listen to them.\n\nThe chicken bacon ranch and \"definitely authentic\" Italiano are outstanding. The bacon, chicken, tomato pieces are thick cut. They don't skip out on the ingredients, sauce, and the quality/freshness of it. They even have some homemade BBQ and jalapeno cilantro they can give on the side. We both really liked the Italiano pizza considering the flavor and the amount of arugula they put on because we asked!\n\nWe're so glad we came! This local Place Pizza has got some good wood fire pizzas without miles to travel to. Comparable to some wood fire pizza places in SLC. These pizzas are fired perfectly. The crusts aren't burnt like some other places do. They are not as greasy or heavy either.\n\nGreat first time experience. It isn't busy here at 5.30pm on a Saturday but 6pm it starts to fill up. And from observation they are so good at updating diners/takeout orders on the waiting time.",

The sauce tasted bland, and the cheese didn‚Äôt really stand out. It felt like it was missing seasoning or something to bring it all together. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was terrible, but definitely below average compared to other spots in the area. Probably won‚Äôt be coming back anytime soon.",

I got the chicken, bacon, ranch pizza.\n\nThe regular pizza I am assuming is a lot better but they really need to improve on their gluten free crust!! Maybe their cauliflower one is better.\n\nThe gluten free pizza also takes so much longer (which I get) but maybe also inform customers of that.

            "text": "Would recommend thinking twice about catering with them.  They were an hour late to our wedding luncheon and this made it so we couldn‚Äôt do some of the activities as planned.  When we confronted them about it they said on the invoice it showed they were supposed to be there at 5:00 when we needed them there at 4:00.  Looked at the invoice and it showed 4:00.  They let us come in before hand and taste the pizza and showed us pictures of their setup.  The pizza was really good and the setup potential was promising.  Then at our venue the pizza was mid at best and really flimsy.  Then the setup was not what we were promised and looked really rushed.  Not impressed.",
