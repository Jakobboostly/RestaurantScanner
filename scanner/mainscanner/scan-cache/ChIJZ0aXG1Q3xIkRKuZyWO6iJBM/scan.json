Under the pizza slices was (surprise) another pool of grease. We had to put the mouthful in a napkin and the other slice we didn‚Äôt even bother. The waitress only took one slice of pepperoni off the bill. My husband just wanted to leave. When they brought the slices they left cold bread and cold pizza sauce in a small bowl on the table for my Stromboli. Who serves cold sauce with no Stromboli together? It sat on the table cold. We are nice people and still tipped and the service was below par. We won‚Äôt be back. We also took the Stromboli home and there was 2 hairs in the food.",

I have to give a shout out to Preston? He was there when our server wasn't and happily ran for a soda refill for us. I gave him a tip. Super nice kid. Only complaint is the paper they put under the cheese steak  falls apart. Why not just serve it on a plate? Update: we went back. We orderes a large cheese steak and pierogies to share. Holy large!!! It was huge. I couldnt eat all my half and my husband couldnt eat his half!!! It was delish.\nI bought a coupon off Clipp. Was excited to try the place. My son graduated from the police acadamy tonight so we needed a place to celebrate . I called a few mins before we arrived. They got a table ready for us. There was initial confusion about who was waiting on us but once we got waited on...he was fantastic. I wish I knew his name so he could get credit. The only complaint our party of 5 had was my salad. There was 3 little pieces of Cucumber and 3 cherry tomatoes. That's it. No Crutton's,onions, or cheese. It was super boring. My Manicotti and garlic bread was good. My daughters pasta, the cheese steak, peanut butter maple burger and French onion burger were all very good. Even the soda was good. The price was spot on. The owner? Came over to ask how our food was. You can tell everyone really wants you to have a good experience. Glad I bought the clipp coupon. We will definitely go back.",

Under the pizza slices was (surprise) another pool of grease. We had to put the mouthful in a napkin and the other slice we didn‚Äôt even bother. The waitress only took one slice of pepperoni off the bill. My husband just wanted to leave. When they brought the slices they left cold bread and cold pizza sauce in a small bowl on the table for my Stromboli. Who serves cold sauce with no Stromboli together? It sat on the table cold. We are nice people and still tipped and the service was below par. We won‚Äôt be back. We also took the Stromboli home and there was 2 hairs in the food.",

          "text": "Another update: Went back a 3rd time! We shared another 22 inch cheese steak. This time with Cooper cheeae. Yum. I also had them add sweet peppers to the hot peppers and pickles. I have to give a shout out to Preston? He was there when our server wasn't and happily ran for a soda refill for us. I gave him a tip. Super nice kid. Only complaint is the paper they put under the cheese steak  falls apart. Why not just serve it on a plate? Update: we went back. We orderes a large cheese steak and pierogies to share. Holy large!!! It was huge. I couldnt eat all my half and my husband couldnt eat his half!!! It was delish.\nI bought a coupon off Clipp. Was excited to try the place. My son graduated from the police acadamy tonight so we needed a place to celebrate . I called a few mins before we arrived. They got a table ready for us. There was initial confusion about who was waiting on us but once we got waited on...he was fantastic. I wish I knew his name so he could get credit. The only complaint our party of 5 had was my salad. There was 3 little pieces of Cucumber and 3 cherry tomatoes. That's it. No Crutton's,onions, or cheese. It was super boring. My Manicotti and garlic bread was good. My daughters pasta, the cheese steak, peanut butter maple burger and French onion burger were all very good. Even the soda was good. The price was spot on. The owner? Came over to ask how our food was. You can tell everyone really wants you to have a good experience. Glad I bought the clipp coupon. We will definitely go back.",
