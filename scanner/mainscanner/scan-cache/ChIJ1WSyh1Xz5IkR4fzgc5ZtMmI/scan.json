It was a great steak and cheese, the only problem was that they got my order wrong. I usually would have called them back, but I was starving and was able to get the toppings I didn't want off the sandwich pretty easily. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I got the sandwich I ordered. I will definitely be going  back to get the steak and cheese I wanted.",

It was a great steak and cheese, the only problem was that they got my order wrong. I usually would have called them back, but I was starving and was able to get the toppings I didn't want off the sandwich pretty easily. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I got the sandwich I ordered. I will definitely be going  back to get the steak and cheese I wanted.",
