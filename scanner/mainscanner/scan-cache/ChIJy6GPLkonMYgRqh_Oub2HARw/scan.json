I ordered the scallops and shrimp fettucine and this was great.  2 people ordered the cavatelli with chicken and 1 other ordered the jambalaya.  All were not bad but nothing above what I've had elsewhere.  My gumbo was great.  Just fyi, you only get 2 scallops with the scallop appetizer - for $20.  Calamari rings were nice and thick.  I'd rather have plain marinara to dip in.  3 of us had a mixed drink.  With tip, our total for 4 was $290.  We sat in the patio on a hot day and even though it was covered and fans were going, there was not much air movement, surprisingly. So a little warm.  Also ambience of the parking lot is nothing special. Basically overlooks parking.  Server very nice but was slow. I live about 35 min away and if I'm in the area, will likely come back",

We‚Äôve been back three times in the last year  and each time Russo‚Äôs has provided an enjoyable dining experience for us.\n\nMy wife and I like this restaurant for its food, delicious cocktails and good service. It's been a great ‚Äòre-discovery‚Äô for us and it has become our go-to restaurant when we want to have a really special dining experience.\n\nThis isn't a place where you can just show up and find a table‚Äîit's popular, so reservations are really necessary to guarantee a spot to eat.\n\nThe dishes we‚Äôve had here are delicious and in just-right proportions. We've come here with just ourselves and once with friends and have not been disappointed.\n\nOur servers have also been an important part of our dining experience at Russo's. They've all been personable and attentive.\n\nRusso's has two places to dine that offer two completely different experiences: the main dining room and the Bacchus Room. The main dining room has a combination of booths and tables in a carpeted area, making for a quieter atmosphere. The Bacchus Room is more of a casual sports bar type of area. It is a simple area with bare floors, standard tables, TVs with sports games on them and a bar, but also with garage doors that can open up to a patio in nicer weather.\n\nBoth areas now have the same menu. The most recent time we came we had to sit in the Bacchus Room because the main dining room was full and we could only get reservations for Bacchus. We still had excellent service and a tasty meal.\n\nFinally, we've really enjoyed the cocktails here, especially the martinis. Great espresso martini and the sour apple has become one of my favorites.\n\nBe prepared to pay a little more to eat here, as we have generally found entrees to be around $35 on up and cocktails were about $12, BUT...so worth it!\n\nWe look forward to returning.",

I ordered the scallops and shrimp fettucine and this was great.  2 people ordered the cavatelli with chicken and 1 other ordered the jambalaya.  All were not bad but nothing above what I've had elsewhere.  My gumbo was great.  Just fyi, you only get 2 scallops with the scallop appetizer - for $20.  Calamari rings were nice and thick.  I'd rather have plain marinara to dip in.  3 of us had a mixed drink.  With tip, our total for 4 was $290.  We sat in the patio on a hot day and even though it was covered and fans were going, there was not much air movement, surprisingly. So a little warm.  Also ambience of the parking lot is nothing special. Basically overlooks parking.  Server very nice but was slow. I live about 35 min away and if I'm in the area, will likely come back",

I ordered the scallops and shrimp fettucine and this was great.  2 people ordered the cavatelli with chicken and 1 other ordered the jambalaya.  All were not bad but nothing above what I've had elsewhere.  My gumbo was great.  Just fyi, you only get 2 scallops with the scallop appetizer - for $20.  Calamari rings were nice and thick.  I'd rather have plain marinara to dip in.  3 of us had a mixed drink.  With tip, our total for 4 was $290.  We sat in the patio on a hot day and even though it was covered and fans were going, there was not much air movement, surprisingly. So a little warm.  Also ambience of the parking lot is nothing special. Basically overlooks parking.  Server very nice but was slow. I live about 35 min away and if I'm in the area, will likely come back",

We‚Äôve been back three times in the last year  and each time Russo‚Äôs has provided an enjoyable dining experience for us.\n\nMy wife and I like this restaurant for its food, delicious cocktails and good service. It's been a great ‚Äòre-discovery‚Äô for us and it has become our go-to restaurant when we want to have a really special dining experience.\n\nThis isn't a place where you can just show up and find a table‚Äîit's popular, so reservations are really necessary to guarantee a spot to eat.\n\nThe dishes we‚Äôve had here are delicious and in just-right proportions. We've come here with just ourselves and once with friends and have not been disappointed.\n\nOur servers have also been an important part of our dining experience at Russo's. They've all been personable and attentive.\n\nRusso's has two places to dine that offer two completely different experiences: the main dining room and the Bacchus Room. The main dining room has a combination of booths and tables in a carpeted area, making for a quieter atmosphere. The Bacchus Room is more of a casual sports bar type of area. It is a simple area with bare floors, standard tables, TVs with sports games on them and a bar, but also with garage doors that can open up to a patio in nicer weather.\n\nBoth areas now have the same menu. The most recent time we came we had to sit in the Bacchus Room because the main dining room was full and we could only get reservations for Bacchus. We still had excellent service and a tasty meal.\n\nFinally, we've really enjoyed the cocktails here, especially the martinis. Great espresso martini and the sour apple has become one of my favorites.\n\nBe prepared to pay a little more to eat here, as we have generally found entrees to be around $35 on up and cocktails were about $12, BUT...so worth it!\n\nWe look forward to returning.",

There were four tables including booths that were open and they lied and said they didn't have anything while whiskwhispering to each other.  They were holding tables for their white customers and since we didn't look like their ideal customer our money wasn't good enough.   On the way out there were a 630 Roberts customer that was sat immediately.  Apparently only Italians are allowed here.   Don't go here unless you are Italian or at least look like it.",

The food is absolutely outstanding. Every dish we had was light, exceedingly fresh, and very generous portions. The menu offerings are unique. The balance of flavors in everything we ordered was perfect.\n\nThey have an open kitchen and you can watch as they prepare the meals. It is one of the most impressive operations I‚Äôve ever seen. Fast, efficient, and high quality all on display in a great atmosphere.\n\nThe staff at Russo‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt have been nicer. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Lisa took care of our table. Ask for her when you visit. She‚Äôs an absolute delight.\n\nWe will definitely be visiting again next time we are in the area. We both agreed that if we lived locally we would be at Russo‚Äôs all the time. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great night out of fine dining with good quality people.",

The other container was the jambalaya at a whopping charge of $25. Russo's should be embarrassed to charge these prices for this serving size.\n\nThe gumbo lacked the depth of flavor it had in the past and the jambalaya rice was way overcooked.\n\nAvoid unless you have money to burn.",

          "text": "(9-2023 Update) What COVID? Russo's is back to its normal self. Workers, although some new, are doing well. Place can get bust around 7pm, so make a RESERVATION please. Chef is consistent & does a great job. (8-2022 Update)  The place is back to near normal, with the newer workers.  Ask for prices before you order anything special. Ask for John the bartender, he will make you the best drinks anywhere - a real Gray-Beard at work (*with utmost respect).\n(5-22 Update)- Russo's has lost some talent (Sheela, and perhaps others). Good/ tanlented People make Russo's. Hope to see some new/ good talent soon - did not see it today. Took away a star today.\n(3-22 Update)- Nice to see Russo's returning back to pre-COVID ambience.  Prices seem a bit higher,  but that's expected  - thanks Brandon.\n<Previous Review>Russo's has survived the pandemic,  and slowly returning back. Food + Margarita was good.. expensive, but worth it. Place is bigger than what you see from the street. Menu changes at times, but always good. Call ahead and make a reservation to play it safe. Well stocked bar, ask for your preferred drink, regardless if it is not on the menu.\nMay 2023 -be at peace, Russo's is back to its full glory after the COVID fiasco...all is good here.",
