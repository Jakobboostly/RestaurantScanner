It FAR exceeded our expectations and the staff was incredible and went above and beyond ehat I have ever seen at a restaurant. I'm assuming I spoke to the owner who was so amazingly kind and the other person working gave amazing suggestions as well.  I have never met such incredible people while at a pizza place. They seemed to know everyone that entered by name in my short time waiting. It was so neat to witness that kind of community. Once we got our food I realized the reviews don't even do it justice. We got 2 different types of pizza and some breadsticks and oh my word.... Best pizza we have ever tasted 100%! The crust was absolutely amazing and the breadsticks tasted so good, especially with the garlic cream cheese dip and fresh taste. To top it off we were blessed to try the yummy dessert and would definitely splurge on it in the future. Super rich but so tasty!! If you're in the mood for pizza don't try anywhere else... this place will become your favorite!!!",

When we came in my boyfriend (who name is Sheldon) asked where Sheldon was. The owner Sheldon in a funny way said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to meet that guy‚Äù. We all laughed and knew we had just met Sheldon. We loved that he tried to trick us haha!  The owner Sheldon helped us decide what to order. He personally told the workers in the back he would make our order. We had a deli sandwich and it was amazing! We ended up eating it before we left the restaurant. We ordered 2 small pizzas, one which he told us he would upgrade to a large and wouldn‚Äôt charge us. We were amazed at how kind Sheldon was.  My boyfriend Sheldon goes ‚ÄúI am coming back here!‚Äù The owner Sheldon and my Sheldon took a picture together too. It was like we had been knowing each other for a while and had just met. Great experiences from all around. Great food, great service, great environment, great personality! I hope whoever reads this review doesn‚Äôt think twice about coming here. Please trust me on this, try Sheldon‚Äôs Street Pizza!!! Hands down, the best!",

          "text": "Omg! I just had the best experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I came from out of town and found this place online. When we came in my boyfriend (who name is Sheldon) asked where Sheldon was. The owner Sheldon in a funny way said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to meet that guy‚Äù. We all laughed and knew we had just met Sheldon. We loved that he tried to trick us haha!  The owner Sheldon helped us decide what to order. He personally told the workers in the back he would make our order. We had a deli sandwich and it was amazing! We ended up eating it before we left the restaurant. We ordered 2 small pizzas, one which he told us he would upgrade to a large and wouldn‚Äôt charge us. We were amazed at how kind Sheldon was.  My boyfriend Sheldon goes ‚ÄúI am coming back here!‚Äù The owner Sheldon and my Sheldon took a picture together too. It was like we had been knowing each other for a while and had just met. Great experiences from all around. Great food, great service, great environment, great personality! I hope whoever reads this review doesn‚Äôt think twice about coming here.

It FAR exceeded our expectations and the staff was incredible and went above and beyond ehat I have ever seen at a restaurant. I'm assuming I spoke to the owner who was so amazingly kind and the other person working gave amazing suggestions as well.  I have never met such incredible people while at a pizza place. They seemed to know everyone that entered by name in my short time waiting. It was so neat to witness that kind of community. Once we got our food I realized the reviews don't even do it justice. We got 2 different types of pizza and some breadsticks and oh my word.... Best pizza we have ever tasted 100%! The crust was absolutely amazing and the breadsticks tasted so good, especially with the garlic cream cheese dip and fresh taste. To top it off we were blessed to try the yummy dessert and would definitely splurge on it in the future. Super rich but so tasty!! If you're in the mood for pizza don't try anywhere else... this place will become your favorite!!!",

No hesitation. The crust on the pizza was unreal ‚Äî perfectly pillowy and crispy at the same time ‚Äî and every bite made it clear they‚Äôre using high-quality ingredients.\n\nWe demolished the entire pizza in the car, too.

When we came in my boyfriend (who name is Sheldon) asked where Sheldon was. The owner Sheldon in a funny way said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to meet that guy‚Äù. We all laughed and knew we had just met Sheldon. We loved that he tried to trick us haha!  The owner Sheldon helped us decide what to order. He personally told the workers in the back he would make our order. We had a deli sandwich and it was amazing! We ended up eating it before we left the restaurant. We ordered 2 small pizzas, one which he told us he would upgrade to a large and wouldn‚Äôt charge us. We were amazed at how kind Sheldon was.  My boyfriend Sheldon goes ‚ÄúI am coming back here!‚Äù The owner Sheldon and my Sheldon took a picture together too. It was like we had been knowing each other for a while and had just met. Great experiences from all around. Great food, great service, great environment, great personality! I hope whoever reads this review doesn‚Äôt think twice about coming here. Please trust me on this, try Sheldon‚Äôs Street Pizza!!! Hands down, the best!",
