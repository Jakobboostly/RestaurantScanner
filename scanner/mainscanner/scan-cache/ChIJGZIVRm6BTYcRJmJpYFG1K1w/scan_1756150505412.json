Super glad I went in and a cool guy named Josh asked if it was our first time in and he proceeded to let us know what's great and popular on the menu. Service and atmosphere were great but the burgers were omg soooo good üëç love how big they were and we'll presented. They tasted amazing and I will definitely be coming back to try more. The Mac and cheese was good as well even though it seemed to be made with Velveeta cheese base. The Cole slaw I really enjoyed as well. If any feedback for things to work on I'd say different cheese for the Mac and maybe to work on the salads a bit. Salad we ordered was a bit underwhelming but hey even if they only had burgers that's what they get right 100%. Also the cost to add a combo was quite a bit extra but makes sense when the side is good as well. Bathrooms were also kept up and the place was really clean. üëå Thanks again for the help Josh and it's good to see someone passionate about their work and just doing a great job providing service in general.",

I can't tell the if the name has anything to do with being a healthy-food place, but the sign on the door hints that Root is just the name or nickname of the founder. However, that said, they do have some nice salad options (especially for a fastfood-style establishment). I really enjoyed the island burger. And my daughter liked her Mac and Cheese kids meal.",

Super glad I went in and a cool guy named Josh asked if it was our first time in and he proceeded to let us know what's great and popular on the menu. Service and atmosphere were great but the burgers were omg soooo good üëç love how big they were and we'll presented. They tasted amazing and I will definitely be coming back to try more. The Mac and cheese was good as well even though it seemed to be made with Velveeta cheese base. The Cole slaw I really enjoyed as well. If any feedback for things to work on I'd say different cheese for the Mac and maybe to work on the salads a bit. Salad we ordered was a bit underwhelming but hey even if they only had burgers that's what they get right 100%. Also the cost to add a combo was quite a bit extra but makes sense when the side is good as well. Bathrooms were also kept up and the place was really clean. üëå Thanks again for the help Josh and it's good to see someone passionate about their work and just doing a great job providing service in general.",

We had a group of about 7 adults and were able to put tables together to sit. These burgers are priced high because they are HUGE. In and out is just down the street and I am a fan of their food but this burger is the equivalent of 3 in and out burgers. Hence the price. I personally got their Tomato Tango and it was PHENOMENAL. Big bruschetta fan and this was the burger form. I had tried their salad once before and wasn‚Äôt a fan of the cold chicken. Just like with every other place you go to stick to what they are good at. Would love to try their breakfast sometime. Also the fries were fresh hot and perfectly seasoned. Overall, a great experience and even better food. Support local because I would love this place to stick around!",

When I looked at it, I could see that after they topped the burger with onions and mushrooms I could see fresh salt and pepper on top of the mushrooms. The onion rings were awesome‚Ä¶. But oh my goodness they were so salty. My wife got the Farm Burger and it was great! I think the Tender that comes on the burger uses the same batter as the onion rings because it was just so salty. We love seasoned food but it was a touch too much. I would 100% go back, maybe they just had a hole in their salt shaker! But that would be my only complaint.

But we had our food in 10-15 mins.\n\nThis place for me is a solid 4-4 1/2 stars, and not 5, for just 1 reason...I love a little pink in my burgers. Had I had the option of a medium cooked burger,  this place would have been 5 stars.\n\nAnd who ever was running the place, was extremely helpful and kind.

Each burger comes with a 7 oz patty as well as the specialty you want. There are lots of unique burgers that all looked very good. I went with the burria burger and my wife ordered the island burger with garlic parm fries. And all of it was extremely delicious. We will definitely be returning here to try the rest of the menu. 10/10 experience and highly recommend!",

They have a cool option to try two smaller portion sides together instead of having to pick just one, this was perfect cause I‚Äôm very indecisive lol.\n\nSecond, the employees went above and beyond with their service! We were immediately greeted by a friendly and personable cashier who offered suggestions since it was our first time. We received our food quickly and the employee who gave us our food got us a separate tray to share and was very happy/friendly.

The staff? Whew‚Äîso freaking nice, it almost threw me off. You ever been somewhere and the folks are so friendly you‚Äôre lowkey wondering if they know you from somewhere? That‚Äôs the vibe here. They treat you like fam, not just a customer.\n\nAnd baby‚Ä¶let‚Äôs talk about the food. I came for a sandwich and left with a whole new standard for what comfort food should be. Every bite slapped‚Äîjuicy, flavorful, built just right. But what stole the show? THE CHEESE CURDS. Listen. These things are garlicky, gooey, and crispy like a fresh fade‚Äîlegit some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Crunch on the outside, melty magic on the inside. They really said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt play when it comes to snacks.‚Äù\n\nAnd shout out to the staff again for the fire recommendations‚Äîthey clearly know their menu like a playlist they‚Äôve had on repeat. You can tell they care, and that makes the whole experience hit different.\n\nIf you‚Äôre anywhere near Root‚Äôs Place and you don‚Äôt stop in, you‚Äôre playing yourself. Great food, bomb vibes, and people who make you feel like you belong. 10/10‚ÄîRoot‚Äôs ain‚Äôt just a burger joint, it‚Äôs a whole mood.",

They come out to greet you, help you decide, give you the low down and are just great people. Great beer selection for a hole in the wall joint in dry ass utah where all the drinks are watered down. The onion rings are good but the fries are where its at! Now for the burger.....im speechless...really, i have a little tear in my eye just thinking about this delectable slice of heaven. The meat is amazing, super juicy, all the veggies are crisp and fresh, the bun....oh man, thr bun, fresh and chewy..they grill it a but to add some extra flavor and....on first bite, you'll know you arrived at heavens gates.....the burger kind...not the momon kind. Anyhow, if you're searching for a life changing burger, one that will throw your career into overdrive, one that will supercharge for ferrari, one that will make your girlfriend finally respect you.....ok, it def wont do that, but you gotta eat here. Take it from me...i've put on 10lbs eating here every day for a month. The owner wrote me into his will!! Crazy. I love this place!!!!",

I had the triple breakfast. It includes 3 eggs, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausage patties, hash browns or seasoned potatoes, two slices of toast, and a pancake! It was super good! The over easy eggs were spot on, and the pancake was fluffy and awesome. It was probably the best I've had in my life, tbh. Perfectly crisp, thick cut bacon was really good. I highly recommend Roots Place! Coming back to try the Sweet and Nutty Burger, which is a 1/2 pound patty with grilled onions, bacon, and Nutella! I know...\nThe restrooms were very clean.",

I‚Äôve had Root‚Äôs on my list of burger places to try and had high hopes after all the raving reviews, but I am seriously disappointed.\n\nMy burger was incredibly overcooked and dense to the point that it was tough to chew and I couldn‚Äôt finish it (I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a burger this overcooked). I even had to stand up and double check that they weren‚Äôt serving frozen patties at that price point. I don‚Äôt see many other reviews with this issue, but some complaints about their burgers being pink. I would have much preferred that!\n\nIs there a quality control issue maybe? There‚Äôs no way the reviews could be this positive if my experience was the norm. Unfortunately, it will be extremely difficult to risk trying again with prices even higher than pretty much every other quality burger joint in the area.\n\nThe only reason I didn‚Äôt give 2 stars was because the food was very hot, served fresh, and the staff were all very friendly. The burger also at least had a very nice sear, which shows promise that maybe they just made a mistake with mine? I feel bad not giving 5 stars, but as a burger lover, if the meat is bad, no amount of flashy toppings will save it.",

You can tell management really cares that everyone has a great experience. I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed. Shakes are also fire! I‚Äôd recommend a hangover burger ask the hashbrowns on the side at avocado. The over easy egg on the burger  is 10 out of 10.",

I‚Äôve had a chicken sando before and it was alright but I just tried their burger, it was a 3/10.\n\nBurger patty had no salt, no seasoning and the fries were over cooked and no flavor at all either.\n\nSorry but I‚Äôm tired of these 5/5 star reviews everyone gives nowadays. This place is alright.",
