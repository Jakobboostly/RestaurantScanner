          "text": "If you haven't been to this location, you are truly missing out! Fellini Newtown Square (formerly called Fellini Cafe) is my all-time favorite Italian restaurant! They're a family-owned business that takes great pride in their food and providing exceptional service.\n\nI've been dining here for 20 years, but unfortunately, I moved to NC in 2013, so the opportunities to get back have grown few and far between. My brother and I were in the area last December, and they had just completed a renovation of the entire place‚Äîso cool to see after it being so long since we visited. The food was exactly as we remembered: fresh, delicious, and high quality!\n\nThe dressing on their salad is something I've tried to duplicate at home, but it just never hits the mark‚Äîso, I'm convinced they're using magic. :-) Fresh bread? It's like NOTHING in NC‚Äîunfortunately for me, I'm not kidding.\n\nAnyway, they offer a very robust menu with many Italian classics and their own specialties. They've never turned down modifications on dishes‚Äîliterally, I've never had anything bad here. My mom ordered eggplant parm one time, and I don't even like eggplant‚Äîbut I liked this one. Calamari, salad, soup, pastas, pizza, desserts... they have something for everyone.\n\nAlmost forgot‚Äîthey're also BYOB, so bring your favorite bottle for everyone in your party and enjoy! The venue is small and may have slightly more seating capacity after their renovation, but we almost always made reservations before moving‚Äîwhether it be lunch or dinner. They also accept large party reservations with advance notice.\n\nTheir parking is very limited, with more signs than ever dictating \"customer parking only\" for various businesses. If you‚Äôre going during peak hours, be prepared to wait for a spot in the front lot. You can also buy alcohol past the bank and Verizon store at Newtown Suds (to stash in your trunk) and then walk down, or park across the (small) highway in the ACME shopping center for free.\n\nIn summation‚Ä¶ just gather your favorite people, bring some wine, and enjoy this spot!",

The Grilled Artichokes were a standout dish, with the Roman artichokes perfectly grilled and paired with fresh mozzarella, green olives, sliced prosciutto, shredded parmesan, and a drizzle of truffle oil. Each bite was bursting with flavor and the combination of ingredients was simply divine.\n\nThe Fried Calamari was also a hit, with the fresh squid lightly battered and fried to perfection. The marinara sauce served alongside added a nice tangy kick to the dish.\n\nFor the main course, I tried the Involtini Fellini, a unique dish featuring veal, spinach, blue cheese, and cream. The flavors worked harmoniously together and the veal was incredibly tender.\n\nLastly, the Penne alla Vodka with shrimp was a comforting and indulgent choice. The tomato cream sauce reduced in vodka added a rich and creamy element to the dish, and the shrimp were cooked to perfection.\n\nOverall, my dining experience at Fellini Cafe was exceptional. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, the service by Patricio was top-notch, and the food was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic Italian dining experience in Newtown Square.",

          "text": "If you haven't been to this location, you are truly missing out! Fellini Newtown Square (formerly called Fellini Cafe) is my all-time favorite Italian restaurant! They're a family-owned business that takes great pride in their food and providing exceptional service.\n\nI've been dining here for 20 years, but unfortunately, I moved to NC in 2013, so the opportunities to get back have grown few and far between. My brother and I were in the area last December, and they had just completed a renovation of the entire place‚Äîso cool to see after it being so long since we visited. The food was exactly as we remembered: fresh, delicious, and high quality!\n\nThe dressing on their salad is something I've tried to duplicate at home, but it just never hits the mark‚Äîso, I'm convinced they're using magic. :-) Fresh bread? It's like NOTHING in NC‚Äîunfortunately for me, I'm not kidding.\n\nAnyway, they offer a very robust menu with many Italian classics and their own specialties. They've never turned down modifications on dishes‚Äîliterally, I've never had anything bad here. My mom ordered eggplant parm one time, and I don't even like eggplant‚Äîbut I liked this one. Calamari, salad, soup, pastas, pizza, desserts... they have something for everyone.\n\nAlmost forgot‚Äîthey're also BYOB, so bring your favorite bottle for everyone in your party and enjoy! The venue is small and may have slightly more seating capacity after their renovation, but we almost always made reservations before moving‚Äîwhether it be lunch or dinner. They also accept large party reservations with advance notice.\n\nTheir parking is very limited, with more signs than ever dictating \"customer parking only\" for various businesses. If you‚Äôre going during peak hours, be prepared to wait for a spot in the front lot. You can also buy alcohol past the bank and Verizon store at Newtown Suds (to stash in your trunk) and then walk down, or park across the (small) highway in the ACME shopping center for free.\n\nIn summation‚Ä¶ just gather your favorite people, bring some wine, and enjoy this spot!",

First off we were warmly welcomed by a very lovely gentleman who was the manager, he brought us to our table. Its BYOB, I brought one of the wines from my private collection, it paired well with our meal overall. We started off with crispy calamari fritti, prepared to perfection, tender and absolutely delicious with marinara and the bread with EVOO, was lovely.  Now to our meals. Both my parents opted for veal parmesan, they enjoyed it. I opted for the chicken parmesan, now I have a minor critique, as a Culinarian/Foodie and a Sicilian, I am not a fan of my chicken parmesan completely drowning in sauce, I like to be able to taste the crispiness of the chicken cutlets, just lightly sauced on top & cheese. Other than that everything was great! We ended our dinner with Cannolis, they were a perfect ending. Fellini Cafe is Highly Recommended! Tell them Charlie sent ya!",

          "text": "I was there with my husband after they did the remodel of the restaurant. It‚Äôs way more cluttered not a big fan. Much more tinier. However, what is really the main reason I am writing a review is the service we had. She never introduced herself but she was a young petite blonde girl. She was extremely arrogant/ignorant. When we weren‚Äôt ready to order she rolled her eyes while walking away. Got the food cold and never came to check on us. Had to ask another waitress to open our wine as our waitress never came back to check on us. Couldn‚Äôt even get a dessert because the next time she came back she just put the check on the table without asking us if there was anything else we needed, no how was the food, nothing. I‚Äôm a server too and she was a disgrace. When we got the check they add on a service charge if you use a credit card but was added on the total of the bill. When we asked for our waitress to come back we asked her about it and she rudely replied ‚Äúuse cash and you want have that problem‚Äù as she walked away. We couldn‚Äôt believe that answer she gave us. I don‚Äôt understand why they even charge a service charge is ridiculous. How cheap do you have to be to charge your customer service charge when they make all this money.\nNeedless to say we will NOT be back and have spread the word and will continue to do so. I have been told similar bad experiences from people I know that won‚Äôt go back. The waitress should not be working with the public or get a job she enjoys.",

Those not drinking wine were never offered anything else to drink other than water that was given to us all upon being seated. The bus boy tried  removing plates that we weren‚Äôt finished with yet. Gave us a feeling of being rushed and unwelcomed. We asked for boxes and when the food was returned it was placed on the floor. After getting home found 2 meals were mixed together. Again great food but the dining in experience fell short of expectations.",

The dinning experience was nothing short of of chaos. Also my wife wasn't half way through her dinner, and the waitress was asking if we wanted deserts. We declined deserts, and a minute later the check was handed to us. Also were were conversing with a woman dinning alone, in the middle of eating the owner came over and moved her table, while she was in mid bite. Totally unacceptable. She was not happy, yet the mater D said she said thank you. She did not. It was never this way before the recent renovations. We have never felt so rushed while having dinner, in the 25 years we've been together. It's a shame, always liked it there. However we will not return.",

The Grilled Artichokes were a standout dish, with the Roman artichokes perfectly grilled and paired with fresh mozzarella, green olives, sliced prosciutto, shredded parmesan, and a drizzle of truffle oil. Each bite was bursting with flavor and the combination of ingredients was simply divine.\n\nThe Fried Calamari was also a hit, with the fresh squid lightly battered and fried to perfection. The marinara sauce served alongside added a nice tangy kick to the dish.\n\nFor the main course, I tried the Involtini Fellini, a unique dish featuring veal, spinach, blue cheese, and cream. The flavors worked harmoniously together and the veal was incredibly tender.\n\nLastly, the Penne alla Vodka with shrimp was a comforting and indulgent choice. The tomato cream sauce reduced in vodka added a rich and creamy element to the dish, and the shrimp were cooked to perfection.\n\nOverall, my dining experience at Fellini Cafe was exceptional. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, the service by Patricio was top-notch, and the food was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic Italian dining experience in Newtown Square.",

We had take out, Salmon, salad, asparagus.....\nEven with taking the food home, all was very tasty and still warm.\nPlace was packed, not one table open.  It's definitely a louder restaurant.  But that's because the food is so good, place is smaller so it's going to be louder.  Do take out.",
