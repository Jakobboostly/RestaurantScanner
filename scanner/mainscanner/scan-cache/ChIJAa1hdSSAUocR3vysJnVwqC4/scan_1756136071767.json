There was only one person before us and yet it took nearly 40 minutes for us to get our order done.  I ordered the meat eater specialty pizza with spicy red sauce on a keto crust and it was really good.  The Greek side salad on the other hand was the most bland salad I've ever had in my life. The dressing had absolutely no flavor.  In fact, I was given a side container of olive oil which was not the Greek dressing I was expecting.  I was told that the server didn't shake the bottle before serving my dressing so I was given another but it was still just as bland and tasted of pure olive oil.  (I love olive oil just not like this) The salad had no seasoning, No salt no pepper no flavor whatsoever.  It had the essence of feta but not enough to add flavor, only one cherry tomato and a couple pieces of chopped olive which didn't help flavor at all.   My sister ordered the same salad and agreed it was flavorless.  Greek salad is my favorite but this was not it. I don't recommend the Greek salad.\nAside from the extremely slow service and terrible salad the pizza was good.  I will not return on a Sunday though.",

I didn't ask for an explanation. I won't go back to get one either I am getting tired of people in the customer service field that feel like we owe them something for showing up to a place of business.

The no straws is what really seems ridiculous. I don't no if they where just out or it's a new company policy. When I asked the response was more of a statement. \"No Straws\". I didn't ask for an explanation. I won't go back to get one either I am getting tired of people in the customer service field that feel like we owe them something for showing up to a place of business. Maybe they aren't looking at the prices and doing the math. 5-30% is a lot and what do we get for it No Straws lol",

She dismissed me saying yeah we were busy, and she never came out to look at what I was complaining about. Towards the end of my meal at approximately 8:47pm I went back up and ordered a drink, the real manager took that order and tried to hand me a gift certificate, I politely declined and expressed my concern about the the girl's lack of concern for cleanliness, as I was making this complaint, and I cannot make this up, I see a RODANT, BE IT A MOUSE, RAT, OR WHAT HAVE YOU, RUN OUT FROM UNDER THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PIZZA OVEN, AND RUN BACK UNDER IT, WHEN I GO TO SEE WHERE IT RAN TO I SEE A GIANT RODANT TRAP, SO THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.

Pretty much down hill from there.\n\nFirst impressions was just dirty. Food all over floors. 7 employees behind the counter, 4 of which stood leaning against counters or ovens doing nothing, yet shocked to see empty lemonade dispensers, food all over the floor and filthy table tops.\n\nFirst girl seemed to enjoy being at work, second girl treated us like it was a chore and pain to serve us.\n\nPrices compared to other comparable build your own pizza places are high.\n\nChild chairs were left in a variety of random places. Every one of them was gross.\n\nTable and chairs were dirty and sticky. Again, with employees stood around, is there not time to address the dirty lobby?",

I didn't ask for an explanation. I won't go back to get one either I am getting tired of people in the customer service field that feel like we owe them something for showing up to a place of business.
