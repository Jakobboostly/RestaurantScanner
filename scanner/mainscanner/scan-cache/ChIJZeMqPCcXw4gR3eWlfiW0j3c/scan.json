We actually stumbled upon this place by accident on our very first trip, hungry and passing by, and we instantly fell in love. The atmosphere and food were phenomenal, and it quickly became a tradition for us. Every year since, we‚Äôve ordered multiple times during our stay and have spent hundreds of dollars here. It‚Äôs truly been our favorite pizza spot, worth the extra drive.\n\nUnfortunately, this year‚Äôs experience was extremely disappointing. When we placed our order, one of the items was missing. My dad went to pick everything up, and when we realized the mistake, we called and were given the runaround before finally being told we could come back to get the missing item, with just $5 off. After making the drive again, we got home only to discover the pizza was completely burnt and inedible.\n\nIt‚Äôs incredibly sad and frustrating to have our family tradition end on this note, but the service and quality this time were unacceptable. Sadly, we won‚Äôt be returning.",

Danny's has gone down, his pizza pies aren't the same anymore either, you used to get a big slices of pizza in the pies now you get papa John's size slices. Really disappointed.",

The atmosphere and food were phenomenal, and it quickly became a tradition for us. Every year since, we‚Äôve ordered multiple times during our stay and have spent hundreds of dollars here. It‚Äôs truly been our favorite pizza spot, worth the extra drive.\n\nUnfortunately, this year‚Äôs experience was extremely disappointing. When we placed our order, one of the items was missing. My dad went to pick everything up, and when we realized the mistake, we called and were given the runaround before finally being told we could come back to get the missing item, with just $5 off. After making the drive again, we got home only to discover the pizza was completely burnt and inedible.\n\nIt‚Äôs incredibly sad and frustrating to have our family tradition end on this note, but the service and quality this time were unacceptable.

When you get a chicken parm hero it comes with cheese and sauce. In the picture the hero clearly has no sauce. You charged me 15 dollars for a chicken parm hero and didnt put sauce on it. Danny's has gone down, his pizza pies aren't the same anymore either, you used to get a big slices of pizza in the pies now you get papa John's size slices. Really disappointed.",
