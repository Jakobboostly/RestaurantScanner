They didn't give enough green or red sauce, either.

We were hoping that was just a bad day and tried again, but the next time we went it was even worse and we couldn‚Äôt even eat it. Definitely not worth taking the risk of your food not getting cooked properly.",

I would say it‚Äôs definitely not worth the 12 bucks for potatoes. On a side note the hot sauce has some spunk ! The only thing they got right",
