The chicken chunks and wedges are amazing too, and their prices are incredibly fair compared to many other places.\n\nStory time: This morning, my heart was unexpectedly torn apart. I hadn‚Äôt eaten, was crying, and needed some kind of comfort. On a whim, I left a note on my order saying I got my heart broken. When I opened the box, I found the cutest little jokes written inside. It reminded me that sometimes it‚Äôs not just about the food (even though it‚Äôs fantastic). It‚Äôs also about the people behind the counter who take the time to spread a little kindness. And Bobalu‚Äôs has amazing staff, clearly. That small gesture made my awful day feel a little less heavy. A huge shoutout to the employee who took the time to do this, it meant more than you know. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Pizzas were super hot! Delicious-we ordered a full sausage/half Jalape√±o, and another half pepperoni/half mushroom, green peppers, onions anorder of fries and mushrooms everything was delicious. Will definitely order again",

The chicken chunks and wedges are amazing too, and their prices are incredibly fair compared to many other places.\n\nStory time: This morning, my heart was unexpectedly torn apart. I hadn‚Äôt eaten, was crying, and needed some kind of comfort. On a whim, I left a note on my order saying I got my heart broken. When I opened the box, I found the cutest little jokes written inside. It reminded me that sometimes it‚Äôs not just about the food (even though it‚Äôs fantastic). It‚Äôs also about the people behind the counter who take the time to spread a little kindness. And Bobalu‚Äôs has amazing staff, clearly. That small gesture made my awful day feel a little less heavy. A huge shoutout to the employee who took the time to do this, it meant more than you know. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
