He sits, waits and waits and waits.  His pie is now ice cold.  And here is why I never send food back....it wasn't cut, it didn't have extra cheese and 30 minutes after eating 3 small pieces, I am in the bathroom puking my guts up.  Coincidence.?.

They made a pizza wrong so I was there 45 to 50 minutes and of course the first pizza was cold by the time the second was correctly made.  I was not offered to have both remade so they would both be hot. I was not offered a discount.  I was not offered a free dessert or anything else.  I was not offered an apology.  The food,  when hot,  is good.  The prices are very good.  BUT you need to have lots of time to give. Btw at least one and possibly up to three other patrons had problems with their otders. The only satisfied people I noticed were the many employees, friends and family of the employees who seemed to have no ordering issues . If you don't mind a tree house atmospheric waiting for your order to be made correctly,  this place is for you!",

          "text": "After a long hard week of life, we decided to order out to give ourselves a break...boy were we disappointed. The projected 30-40 minute wait for delivery turned into OVER an hour. Our food was cold (we only live one stoplight away!) and our order was wrong. They seem to have difficulty telling the difference between \"REGULAR\" Coke and \"DIET\" Coke and \"BONE IN\" and \"BONELESS\" wings. The pizza was correct, although looked like it had been sitting for awhile as the cheese was hard. And if that wasn't discouraging enough, our delivery person was a middle age man (I'm being polite) who thought leaving his shirt completely unbuttoned (in cold weather) to show off his hairy chest (ugh) was a good idea while SERVING OUR FOOD to us!  (disgusting!)  Then he left our gate WIDE open when he left....even though it was latched upon his arrival. (next time maybe we'll leave our Rottweiler out to greet him! ) Why is there no respect left in this world? !!!\n#neverorderdeliveryfromthisplaceontheweekend\nThe only good part was the poor, sweet girl who had to answer their phone and keep apologizing every time I called back with yet another complaint about my order tonight. #girlyoucangetabetterjob\nDon't say I didn't warn you....we wasted $46 on this disaster.",

Granted i have had multiple deliveries from that store previously with no problems. Again good pizza but will not order from this location again due to the terrible management. I understand if i was too far away and was told the first time that it wasn't available but this is not the case. This is just a owner who picks and chooses what he wants to do.",

I called the restaurant and asked to speak to Lacey, the young lady who took my order.  I explained to her that we had tasted the wings and they were plain and maybe someone forgot to put the sauce on the wings.  She apologized  and offered to send more sauce over or replace the wings.  They promptly made us new wings with plenty of sauce on them and delivered the wings to us.  I gave the original wings to the delivery person.  My husband and son tasted the wings and they were very good with plenty of sauce.  I called Lacey to thank her for the wings and making the effort to correct the matter.  HERE IS WHERE THIS STORY GETS BIZZARRE,  as I am commending Lacey on the phone, the driver knocks on our door questioning why there is only 13 wings in the container we gave back to them.  We explained that everyone tasted a few wings and we all concluded there was no sauce on the wings even after inverting the container to try to mix them.  There was no sauce in the container at all.  I told Lacy as I was talking to her that her driver came back to my door and what he said.  She told me to tell him it was fine and she told me she was glad we were happy with the new wings.  Ten minutes later however, I get a call back from Lacey and she said that it is obvious to her that WE rinsed the wings with water and put them back in the container and that we ate 9 of the 20 wings.  I told her that was ridiculous, why would we do something like that?  Its insane to think that a manager of a restaurant would accuse a customer of lying. Unbelievable that in these times when we are trying to support our local restaurants that someone would treat their customers this way.  AWFUL!  They do not deserve 1 star but google wouldn't let me post the review with 0 stars.",

Food was absolutely horrible. Went from straight out of box straight to the trash. I thought.\nWell instead of throwing it away Maybe I'll give my dog a treat and let him eat. So I didn't.\nJust give $30 away. He's a beagle and he wouldn't even eat it. Wings were raw and  pizza was burnt. You could count the pieces of meat on the pizza. What a joke But I guess the jokes on me today.",
