We had a slice of pepperoni pizza, some cheesy garlic bread, and a calzone. The bread and calzone were made hot and fresh to order, and were out to us in about 15 minutes. The slice of pizza was huge, and the thickness of the crust was perfect for folding. There is a counter with barstools lining the perimeter - it's not a place I'd hang out or select for a business meeting, but perfect for a quick lunch. The employees were friendly and efficient. My partner has been here several times for lunch and keeps going back for the lunch specials, he's also a fan of the gyro.",

That was lame! I had to order from a competitor. Your pizza would have been preferred, but customer service falls short of expectations. 7:45 is too late for pizza delivery? That is a new one to me. Secondly, the last time I ordered, the dough did not have that fragrant sourdourdough aroma or flavor as it used to have. Not sure what went wrong there. You are starting to slack off in your quality and customer service. I haven't given up on you, but wha, wha, wha. Fail tonight and the last time I ordered.",

Plus they have a rewards program to earn points! Both photos are a pepperoni pizza. One is 10 in and the other is their largest size. My wife says this is hands down her favorite pizza place in town! Looks like it would be a fun place to work at! Please never close!\n\nAlso the reviews talking about the crusts must be people who aren't familiar with NY style pizza. It is made differently than a puffy \"fast food \" pizza so I have no complaints about the crust.",

          "text": "I was excited to try this place after seeing it says they're using San Marzano based sauce. I ordered a plain pizza with pepperoni. The crust had a good crunch, not overcooked, but it's overshadowed by toughness. The sauce was sweet, not salty, had good texture, and neutral in flavor.  The cheese lacked prominence, wasn't very cheesy and milky like mozzarella is supposed to be, more akin to a shredded cheese blend. The prices are higher than comparables. If you do a custom pizza becareful if the toppings are the same as one of their other pizzas as it'll be more expensive. Overall the pizza I had was decent but not remarkable. I'd like to try the Queens based on the photo, so I might go back in the future. In my opinion the cheese and crust needs improvement at this price point, especially for the plain that I had.",

            "text": "If you order take out , beware! They will screw you without a courtesy kiss first. I would whole heartedly suggest checking your order before you leave. Twice I've been ripped off on take out. Just the other day I ordered gyro meat , pita bread and tazici , 3 measly things. $20.00 plus dollars later and a 40 mile ride home , I'm trying to choke down a gyro without the tazici sauce.  Never again !",
