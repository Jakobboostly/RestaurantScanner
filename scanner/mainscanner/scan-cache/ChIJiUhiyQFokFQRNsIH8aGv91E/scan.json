At our center, we love partnering with local businesses that care, and Pizza Dudes always delivers in every way.\n\nFor our recent preschool graduation celebration, we reached out the night before the event to ask for help. Not only did you say yes, but Hector went above and beyond to coordinate delivery ahead of schedule. The pizza arrived early, hot, and perfectly timed to close out our celebration.\n\nFrom placing the order to the moment the pizzas rolled in, it truly felt like God was in the details. Every slice was a hit and yes, every single one got eaten. The kids, families, and team enjoyed them. The pizza was absolute fire!\n\nWe just want to say thank you, again and again. You have a lifelong customer in us.\n\nWith love, light, and so much appreciation,  thank you for serving our community so well!",

          "text": "2025-01-23 (Thursday): I had an overall great experience here. Staff was friendly and food was delicious. It can be a little pricey but there are coupons available online and in mailers.\n\nThey have the standard ordering options in-person, by phone, or online.  Carry-out or delivery only.  I placed a carry-out order at about 8:30 pm against a 9:00 pm closing time.  PSA: you may want to give them an extra 15 minutes more than I did.  The first thing that made this place stand out to me is the huge selection of toppings.  I arrived about 10 mins before the estimated ready time. Inside, the place looked tidy and neat. The soda fridge was well stocked.  There isn't much space for customers and there's no place to sit and wait but it was nice and warm.\n\nThe person behind the counter greeted me promptly and was friendly. They explained my food wasn't quite ready yet so I slipped back out to my car to sit and wait.  About 1 minute to the time they said to return, I started to exit my car.... Only to find that person was on their way out to bring my food!  Top notch hand-off.\n\nIt was a 10-minute ride home before I could try the food.  I'll go through my dishes one at a time.\n\nMOZZARELLA STICKS - there is no kitchen-to-table service so breaded & fried food is going to steam a bit before you can eat it.  The sticks were kinda chewy as a result.  Outside of that there was still a bit of crunch, the cheese was ooey gooey and warm, and the seasoning blend in the breading was delicious. It came with a side of marinara that was just enough.  The only downside is that they come 10 in an order and I'd like to see personal serving options.\n\nBREADED BONELESS CHICKEN WINGS - I ordered mine spicy, with Frank's Hot Sauce.  The wings looked lightly dressed in sauce which I thought was the perfect amount.  Again as a breaded food these got a bit chewy.  They seemed a little dry to me and overall this wasn't my favorite.  They did give me a dipping sauce on the side but I didn't try it before writing this - maybe Ranch?\n\nHAND-TOSSED PIZZA - I got Pepperoni and sausage, red sauce, regular mozzarella.  At first glance... The dough looked a little tall.  A bit of char around the outer crust.  Toppings amount was somewhere between appropriate and generous!  There was plenty of cheese. The sauce was tangy, sweet, and seasoned well. The dough had a great mouth feel with firm bites.  You could hold a slice and it didn't flop over.  The crust was crisp with a nice smokey char that gave the flavor a needed boost.  Compared to pizzerias in the northeast, this would be a great \"well done\" pizza, just a little thick in the dough.\n\nPAN STYLE PIZZA - I got pepperoni and jalapenos, red sauce, regular mozzarella.  This... felt like their Holy Grail. The sauce, cheese, and toppings as described above. The dough had a nice firm bed but pillowy top.  The bite was chewy and pleasant.  The crust is where dreams are made reality! It was cooked golden brown and just perfect. It was cookie-crisp.  But brushed with a garlic seasoning.  The occasional stray shred of mozzarella that reached the crust baked in to small bursts of toasted cheese that enhanced the garlic seasoning. I could have made a dish of just this crust and been pleased.\n\n9.5/10 - There are sure to be hits and misses on the menu but this place does pizza VERY well.  Personal portion options and the ability to dine in/eat it fresh from the kitchen would really make it over the top.\n\nEDIT: One last thing to note is my pizzas were cut slice-ready. They must let the pizza rest until the cheese is less fluid before cutting.  This prevents a slice from pulling cheese and toppings off its neighbors. Not a big deal, but a nice touch if you don't have a pizza cutter at home to separate your slices.",

This is the kind of pizza you feel good about eating; its not the greasy, slimy, cheaply made pizza of super major chains. I feel like I got a great deal with so much great tasting food for a great price and very fast delivery. My daughter, who is a very picky eater, said this is her new favorite pizza spot. The sub I ordered was much larger than I expected.  I order 12\" but it's the width of it and how full of equal parts meat, veggies and cheese that really blew me away. Overall, I've had a great first experience. Much better than I had anticipated and I definitely order again for all my pizza needs.",

It's straightforward, with no-frills, and hits the spot. (Pro tip - ask for the parm on the side. Thank me later.) It is take out only and they do not have fountain drinks.",

          "text": "2025-01-23 (Thursday): I had an overall great experience here. Staff was friendly and food was delicious. It can be a little pricey but there are coupons available online and in mailers.\n\nThey have the standard ordering options in-person, by phone, or online.  Carry-out or delivery only.  I placed a carry-out order at about 8:30 pm against a 9:00 pm closing time.  PSA: you may want to give them an extra 15 minutes more than I did.  The first thing that made this place stand out to me is the huge selection of toppings.  I arrived about 10 mins before the estimated ready time. Inside, the place looked tidy and neat. The soda fridge was well stocked.  There isn't much space for customers and there's no place to sit and wait but it was nice and warm.\n\nThe person behind the counter greeted me promptly and was friendly. They explained my food wasn't quite ready yet so I slipped back out to my car to sit and wait.  About 1 minute to the time they said to return, I started to exit my car.... Only to find that person was on their way out to bring my food!  Top notch hand-off.\n\nIt was a 10-minute ride home before I could try the food.  I'll go through my dishes one at a time.\n\nMOZZARELLA STICKS - there is no kitchen-to-table service so breaded & fried food is going to steam a bit before you can eat it.  The sticks were kinda chewy as a result.  Outside of that there was still a bit of crunch, the cheese was ooey gooey and warm, and the seasoning blend in the breading was delicious. It came with a side of marinara that was just enough.  The only downside is that they come 10 in an order and I'd like to see personal serving options.\n\nBREADED BONELESS CHICKEN WINGS - I ordered mine spicy, with Frank's Hot Sauce.  The wings looked lightly dressed in sauce which I thought was the perfect amount.  Again as a breaded food these got a bit chewy.  They seemed a little dry to me and overall this wasn't my favorite.  They did give me a dipping sauce on the side but I didn't try it before writing this - maybe Ranch?\n\nHAND-TOSSED PIZZA - I got Pepperoni and sausage, red sauce, regular mozzarella.  At first glance... The dough looked a little tall.  A bit of char around the outer crust.  Toppings amount was somewhere between appropriate and generous!  There was plenty of cheese. The sauce was tangy, sweet, and seasoned well. The dough had a great mouth feel with firm bites.  You could hold a slice and it didn't flop over.  The crust was crisp with a nice smokey char that gave the flavor a needed boost.  Compared to pizzerias in the northeast, this would be a great \"well done\" pizza, just a little thick in the dough.\n\nPAN STYLE PIZZA - I got pepperoni and jalapenos, red sauce, regular mozzarella.  This... felt like their Holy Grail. The sauce, cheese, and toppings as described above. The dough had a nice firm bed but pillowy top.  The bite was chewy and pleasant.  The crust is where dreams are made reality! It was cooked golden brown and just perfect. It was cookie-crisp.  But brushed with a garlic seasoning.  The occasional stray shred of mozzarella that reached the crust baked in to small bursts of toasted cheese that enhanced the garlic seasoning. I could have made a dish of just this crust and been pleased.\n\n9.5/10 - There are sure to be hits and misses on the menu but this place does pizza VERY well.  Personal portion options and the ability to dine in/eat it fresh from the kitchen would really make it over the top.\n\nEDIT: One last thing to note is my pizzas were cut slice-ready. They must let the pizza rest until the cheese is less fluid before cutting.  This prevents a slice from pulling cheese and toppings off its neighbors. Not a big deal, but a nice touch if you don't have a pizza cutter at home to separate your slices.",

Typically I only take the time for positive reviews and less I‚Äôve really been screwed over and I honestly feel like I‚Äôve been robbed and I always seem to forget year after year just how badly it feels when I go to pizza dudes and spend $60 on a pizza a shaped like a sheet of cardboard with a thin bit of cheese dried out awful the garlic, bacon cheese bread is more like puffed air cracker in the shape of garlic bread, so dry and flaky know that I can‚Äôt even differentiate where the cheese is because even the cheese was such a small amount. It dries out the bacon is probably a fine bacon but again the owner clearly is happy to not have repeat customers and charging what we pay at a quality family owned pizza place, I‚Äôll always forget that I always wished I had just gone to Little Caesars because for 799 you can get a moist buttery garlic the delicious he gooey cheesy you know cheese bread and my family or pizza kind of sewers it‚Äôs what they would eat for every single meal so we deliberately as far as commercial pizza places little Caesars is as low as we go. Otherwise it‚Äôs always a family-owned like Brier Pizza is amazing. Pizza bank is good in Kirkland Renton. I don‚Äôt know I mean Vinces is very good up in the Highlands. That said I‚Äôm doing this because I need to remember not to rob myself and just to go to Little Caesars next time I don‚Äôt know why I always forget just how bad it is I always think to myself. Oh no it‚Äôs just expensive but it‚Äôs really good it is not good and I am so annoyed I want my money back I really really do give me my $60 back and I will remove this review and make a mental note to not forget. Otherwise you know what you‚Äôre doing owner. Your staff is lovely and this is not a testament to them please don‚Äôt waste your money if you have a high standard maybe this is your bread and butter and the brand you like but if you‚Äôre a family, it‚Äôs nothing but pizza so you need a good quality pie and you‚Äôre happy to pay more than just don‚Äôt go here lol or do because again I will support small family owned businesses, but this is just clearly greed at its finest.",

Everytime I have gotten a pizza here my interactions and time inside the restaurant are always very brief... There is no seats to eat inside but I have zero problem with that. So if you are looking to dine in that wont be an option. But if you are looking for some bomb üí£ pizza to take him and dish slices out to the fam... Yeah, I recommend Pizza Dudes.

We enjoyed talking to him while he taught is about the menu and answered some questions we had. THIS PIZZA WAS FANTASTIC! It was hot and fresh out of the oven, I dang near burned my mouth because it was so delicious, I couldn't wait! I highly recommend this place for people that want good pizza at a reasonable price. I paid under  $17 for a large pizza, and I will definitely be back again. I am Italian and very picky about pizza. This spot is a must-try if you have not tried it before.",

            "text": "Ordered online. Tiramisu was frozen, that shocked me. I don't like chewy pizza crust and the taste was cheap, sad to say. The garlic bread was the same chewy pizza crust and burned. Pizza should be airy with a lite chew not gummy. The ribs were good. They were nice to give me two 2 liters of soda instead of cans but it doesn't change the quality of the food. Costumer service is nice but again the food doesn't taste better bc of that. I was disappointed.",

We specifically asked him what he hade READY and he gave us 3 options. The pizza was infact not ready and still being made and about to be put in the oven. This is ridiculous and beyond inconsiderate. We sat in there waiting for over 10minutes when we specifically requested something that was ready on the spot. All he had to say was he didn‚Äôt have anything at the moment and we would‚Äôve gladly went somewhere else. The lack of consideration for our time or honesty is beyond frustrating. Will not be coming back.",
