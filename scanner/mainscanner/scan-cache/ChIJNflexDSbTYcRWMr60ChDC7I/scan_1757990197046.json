My portion of brisket was completely visually different than my coworkers (his were slices and mine was more shredded like left over bits and chunks) and mine had large hard bits of brisket that were very difficult to chew. Not appetizing. The garlic toast and mac n cheese were good, but nothing to write home about. The fries were a poor attempt at home cut fries, definitely missed the mark.\nThe Heirloom Restaurant group should be ashamed about the food that is being put out here and how expensive it is for such small portions. Shame on me for missing the up charge on brisket for the two meat plate, but they did have it displayed and had I seen it I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have got it. Find BBQ elsewhere.
