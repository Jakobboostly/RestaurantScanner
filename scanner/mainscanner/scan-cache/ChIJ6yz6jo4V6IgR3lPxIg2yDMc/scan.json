We got desert as well that was good. The food personally was super overpriced in my opinion and had barely any taste super bland overall our waitress was nice but busy doing other things, but still tried to be attentive and apologized. We were sat down quickly atmosphere was Dark there was a few ladies at the bar intoxicated. It‚Äôs more like a bar with additional sitting and a pool table. Looks like a fun place for locals. Felt more like a pizza üçï and beer kind of place but overall good experience food was OK wouldn‚Äôt go back again. We drove from Hudson, Florida to try it.",

I got the fried calamari and we were shocked at how tender and delicious it was! The sauce, however, I ended up adding salt and CRP. My man got the mussels and they were pretty good but he kept getting shells in bites. I got the calzone as my meal and it was not very good. I could only taste bread and motzerella. Not sure why there was also red sauce in my cheese calzone? My man got the chicken parm and it tasted ok but the chicken was very hard. And it came on about 15 noodles. Their Nutella raspberry cake was pretty yummy tho! I don‚Äôt think we will be going back because it‚Äôs about an hour drive. But not a total disappointment.",

The pizza was fantastic, the cheese pull alone was enough to make you want to order another pie, but I'd recommend asking for it well done if you like your undercarriage a bit crispier.\n\nAll the bread is made in-house (wow is it good), and you can even grab a loaf to take home, which is a nice touch. The atmosphere is a little on the darker side, but they‚Äôve got lamps at the tables that help brighten things up. The menu is huge, so there‚Äôs a ton left for us to try. Next time, I can‚Äôt wait to order the clams with sauce and linguine, it looked incredible.\n\nWe look forward to returning!",

The pizza was fantastic, the cheese pull alone was enough to make you want to order another pie, but I'd recommend asking for it well done if you like your undercarriage a bit crispier.\n\nAll the bread is made in-house (wow is it good), and you can even grab a loaf to take home, which is a nice touch. The atmosphere is a little on the darker side, but they‚Äôve got lamps at the tables that help brighten things up. The menu is huge, so there‚Äôs a ton left for us to try. Next time, I can‚Äôt wait to order the clams with sauce and linguine, it looked incredible.\n\nWe look forward to returning!",

His pizza came out, the waitress said \"I know you ordered it no garlic butter, but the kitchen put it on accidently, are you allergic?\" She/they never offered to re-make his pizza. He cut the crust off, even though that's our favorite part, it wasn't worth his getting sick. We were going to stay for the entertainment, but it was too warm in the building (77 degrees on the thermostat behind us) no air moving. All of that put a damper on our datenight. A new pizza should have been made.",

The toilets were not clean because everybody that couldn‚Äôt Around  go to the bathroom in the urinals peed in the Toilet stalls without lifting the lid.\nI had been going there for years. I asked to speak to the manager, and he was to say the least, not very understanding.

So it starts with 1 basket of only 4 rolls & 1 plate. Not one pad of butter. Again, 13 of us. We get our drinks relatively quick & then forever to take our food orders. Then quite awhile to actually get our food. 3 or 4 of us got pasta dishes that were supposed to come with garlic bread. Not a garlic bread in sight!  Tried a slice of pizza that someone else had ordered & it was disappointing as well. All the food was mediocre at best. You'd think a restaurant called Two Men from Italy would have way better food and service. Won't be going back.",

My man got the mussels and they were pretty good but he kept getting shells in bites. I got the calzone as my meal and it was not very good. I could only taste bread and motzerella. Not sure why there was also red sauce in my cheese calzone? My man got the chicken parm and it tasted ok but the chicken was very hard. And it came on about 15 noodles. Their Nutella raspberry cake was pretty yummy tho! I don‚Äôt think we will be going back because it‚Äôs about an hour drive. But not a total disappointment.",
