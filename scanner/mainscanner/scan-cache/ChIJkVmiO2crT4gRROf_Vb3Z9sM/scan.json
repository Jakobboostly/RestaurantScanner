I also didn't realize how big their pizzas were. My medium was huge. I will be trying their Sicilian style next time, which states more cheese, more sauce, and thicker crust. The staff were super nice, and they have a rewards program for free food.",

The crust has a wonderful flavor as does the sauce and cheese also. I think this will be our go-to place for pizza from now on. BTW: the crust was so moist and delicious that we ate the entire slice. Resturant was super clean and has plenty of tables to relax and enjoy your pie. Very friendly staff and service!! Folks, you've got to try this resturant.\n\n7/9/22. Went here again and had a large pizza with half extra cheese and sausage. Most delicious dinner.\nBTW: if your traveling on I-64 or I-77 and want an EZ off EZ on, this is not far off the highway.",

I informed the lady that we ordered there quite often but no more, she just said whatever. My wife called and ask for the manager and he hung up on her when she complained about her pizza.

I also didn't realize how big their pizzas were. My medium was huge. I will be trying their Sicilian style next time, which states more cheese, more sauce, and thicker crust.

The crust has a wonderful flavor as does the sauce and cheese also. I think this will be our go-to place for pizza from now on. BTW: the crust was so moist and delicious that we ate the entire slice. Resturant was super clean and has plenty of tables to relax and enjoy your pie. Very friendly staff and service!! Folks, you've got to try this resturant.\n\n7/9/22. Went here again and had a large pizza with half extra cheese and sausage. Most delicious dinner.\nBTW: if your traveling on I-64 or I-77 and want an EZ off EZ on, this is not far off the highway.",
