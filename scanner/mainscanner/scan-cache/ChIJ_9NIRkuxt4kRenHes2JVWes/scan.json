Highly recommend.\nThe wings, on the other hand, seemed to be rushed, so they were a bit burned outside and a but undercooked inside, which gave them a weird burt nasty flavor. Not recommended. Price was not too bad, but I could not eat the wings, so that was a waste. Would eat here again but not get wings for sure.",

          "text": "I want to start my review with saying that I have not actually been to Pizza Pie Me, I've only ordered  delivery so I can't comment on the atmosphere of the resturant. I thought that the delivery time was good considering that I ordered at 7PM on a Saturday, when I called and ordered they told me 50 to 55 minutes(which is about what I expected) the delivery driver arrived in about 35 minutes. What I ordered was basically an order of the Chicken Tenders and a Calzone. The chicken tenders were a decent size,  cooked perfectly, moist and had a good crunch with a coating that didn't over power the chicken itself, I would suspect that they were made in house. The Calzone was not only large(the box in the photo is 12 inches square)but very good as well. Crust was soft but firm enough to hold up to the ingreadients. Fillings were flavorful and a good quality. The only negative criticism I have about Pizza Pie Me is that I wanted to replace the red sauce in my Calzone with ranch to basically create a Chicken Bacon Ranch calzone but they wouldn't do it so I ordered light on the tomato sauce and it came out very good, but not exactly what I wanted. I suspect the reason they wouldn't replace tomato sauce with Ranch is because they probably don't have Ranch in bulk, I didn't see any Ranch options for pizza or calzones and when I got Ranch for my Tenders it was in pre-made Ken's cups. Over all I thought that the food was good delivery time was good and the ordering experience was good, I will definatly order again if in the area again.",

          "text": "I want to start my review with saying that I have not actually been to Pizza Pie Me, I've only ordered  delivery so I can't comment on the atmosphere of the resturant. I thought that the delivery time was good considering that I ordered at 7PM on a Saturday, when I called and ordered they told me 50 to 55 minutes(which is about what I expected) the delivery driver arrived in about 35 minutes. What I ordered was basically an order of the Chicken Tenders and a Calzone. The chicken tenders were a decent size,  cooked perfectly, moist and had a good crunch with a coating that didn't over power the chicken itself, I would suspect that they were made in house. The Calzone was not only large(the box in the photo is 12 inches square)but very good as well. Crust was soft but firm enough to hold up to the ingreadients. Fillings were flavorful and a good quality. The only negative criticism I have about Pizza Pie Me is that I wanted to replace the red sauce in my Calzone with ranch to basically create a Chicken Bacon Ranch calzone but they wouldn't do it so I ordered light on the tomato sauce and it came out very good, but not exactly what I wanted. I suspect the reason they wouldn't replace tomato sauce with Ranch is because they probably don't have Ranch in bulk, I didn't see any Ranch options for pizza or calzones and when I got Ranch for my Tenders it was in pre-made Ken's cups. Over all I thought that the food was good delivery time was good and the ordering experience was good, I will definatly order again if in the area again.",

They gave me a pizza with just jalapenos and say I ordered \"pizza and jalapenos\" which doesn't make sense if I picked 2-toppings and it's on the receipt... 2) crazy enough they added the stem of the jalapenos into the pizza.... Is no one paying attention? 3) the customer service is atrocious when I tried to call about the issue, some guy was giving me an attitude and blaming me 4) To top it off, the pizza is tiny (ordered a large) and was ehhhh on taste. The wings are also tiny!!! I forgot to take photos but other customers have taken photos and they are so small with barely any sauce on them",

I order at least twice a month...pastas, pizza, calzones, sandwiches, baked fries, mozzarella sticks, pita bread, breadstickd, cheesybread. They handmake from scratch nearly everything. They got me through the pandemic and some depressing times. Excellent food quality, super fair prices given it is Shirlington, large portions that takes me days to finish. I haven't really gained weight eating like this either (I think its the good ingredients and how easy it is to save leftovers and reheat). I don't want to imagine my neighborhood without PPM! Everyone I told about this place is obsessed. Once in awhile I'll go in to pickup instead of UberEats and the staff are so nice. They tend to run some nice deals on UberEats too.

I will edit this tomorrow...\n\nEdit to owner: I never got a call or refund. I dont care that I was promised a pan and did not get it.

On top of all that, the order had a topping on it that I‚Äôm allergic to. Spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to get it figured out, and still don‚Äôt have the right order. If it were possible to give zero stars, I would. Terrible experience with this pizza place.\n\nUPDATE: I ordered from Pizza Pie Me again a few weeks later thinking that my horrible experience with them the first time might have been an outlier. It was not. Their service was still awful. A full hour after placing my order, it still was not ready for the delivery guy to pick it up to deliver it. In addition, they had not even started working on making the pizza. An hour after the order was placed. This place is HORRIBLE. They are incompetent, slow, rude, and have terrible customer service.

These local shops know how to put do many of the franchised businesses. The pizza had some great texture. It was like a firm soft. It was not doughy and it was not salty either. Nothing overpowered the other ingredients. You can taste the ingredients as it hit your taste buds. Also, fulfilling. I will recommend. It is within walking distance from a mini Mart and what looks to be a park as well. It is open late so enjoy some good pizza in the late night.",

Is no one paying attention? 3) the customer service is atrocious when I tried to call about the issue, some guy was giving me an attitude and blaming me 4) To top it off, the pizza is tiny (ordered a large) and was ehhhh on taste.
