Limited parking available, street parking was the main option. Bar seating and regular tables available inside as well. Definitely would go back if in the area.",

What a difference!\n\nWe were greeted within a minute of walking through the door & had water, chips, and salsa just a minute after being seated.\n\nWe ordered strawberry margs and beef faijitas (medium). Strawberry margs were very good. Lots of strawberry flavor and big strawberry garnish! Fajitas were a huge serving considering it ‚Äúserves 1-2‚Äù. Comes with all the fixings, tender, and piping hot.\n\nOur server was amazing! She was always smiling and checked on us multiple times.\n\nAll-in-all we had a great experience and the food was solid! Recommend checking it out.",

We ordered the Guacamole which is made to order, it's probably my most favorite thing with the thick chips. We had the Fajitas for two and added shrimp, well the shrimp/bacon was old and I could tell it was sitting for a while,  either that or they burnt it.\nThe Cilantro Rice was disappointing, beans tasted like they came from a can.  But, our waiter was great and the place is beautiful, really pretty.  Other than that, nothing exciting about this place, I felt let down but now we know not to go. The prices are okay, we paid about $180 for the two of us. Margaritas were awesome!! The dessert tray look good from far but up close it was not good, they should display fresh desserts every day, these looked like they had been sitting out for a few days, all soggy and melted, falling apart. Other than that, nothing else. Thanks but NO. Definitely need a redo on our Date Night !",

What a difference!\n\nWe were greeted within a minute of walking through the door & had water, chips, and salsa just a minute after being seated.\n\nWe ordered strawberry margs and beef faijitas (medium). Strawberry margs were very good. Lots of strawberry flavor and big strawberry garnish! Fajitas were a huge serving considering it ‚Äúserves 1-2‚Äù. Comes with all the fixings, tender, and piping hot.\n\nOur server was amazing! She was always smiling and checked on us multiple times.\n\nAll-in-all we had a great experience and the food was solid!

The chips were hot and fresh, salsa was nice and warm, beef fajita‚Äôs and carne asada were amazing (some of the best beef of any  Houston Mexican restaurant including Pappasito‚Äôs, El Tiempo and Lupe‚Äôs)! Grilled shrimp\nFajitas were super fresh and not served overcooked. Margaritas were great. Even had live music (great guitar player and singer). Definitely going back.",

Masters of their craft, please pay them more money!!\n2)  The food is better than anywhere we have had in ages, and we eat mexican 2 to 3 times a week. This chef pays very close attention.\n3)  The atmosphere is very relaxing, music is not too loud or too quiet. Comfy chairs, great lighting and the bar area is large an great for meeting new people.\n\nIn conclusion it is quite rare to find a place that has all 3 items listed above,  as connoiseurs we have searched and searched and never found one until now. What a wonderful facility. 100 / 100 Bravo! Please everyone go eat here so we can keep this place around!",

The service was prompt and attentive without being a pain, thanks to bartender, James. I'll be back with family now that the weather is improving for outdoor seating.\n\nUPDATE\nThank goodness this place has a consistent kitchen! I usually come here during off hours because it's deservedly popular. I dropped below 180lbs since mid summer, so this is my go to for off diet splurging.\n\nLATEST UPDATE\nTroubling issues yesterday. The anticipated order of beef quesadillas came without sour cream to counter the sliced jalapeno and the guacamole was stale and off putting. After mentioning it to the bartender, she came back with the news that the kitchen was out of sour cream and yes, the guacamole was bad. She was attentive at least, finally a professional.\n\nOne problem I've always had here is the vanishing wait or bar staff. Until she waited on me ( she is the upstairs manager pressed into bartending for an absentee), the staff seemed to have never worked in a restaurant before, long waits for tea refills, no queries about sweetener or not and the worst, not checking to see if I was ready to pay. They would walk around and never look over to see if I'm done or need anything at all.\n\nDECEMBER 2023\nThe place was surprisingly festively decorated for Christmas, well done. The biggest improvement was the new ATTENTIVE bartender, no more waiting to order, waiting for refill inquiries and no more waiting for the bill to be presented. Plus, she was smiling often, no more dreary looking staff. As usual, the quesadillas were top shelf!",

We ordered the Guacamole which is made to order, it's probably my most favorite thing with the thick chips. We had the Fajitas for two and added shrimp, well the shrimp/bacon was old and I could tell it was sitting for a while,  either that or they burnt it.\nThe Cilantro Rice was disappointing, beans tasted like they came from a can.  But, our waiter was great and the place is beautiful, really pretty.  Other than that, nothing exciting about this place, I felt let down but now we know not to go. The prices are okay, we paid about $180 for the two of us. Margaritas were awesome!! The dessert tray look good from far but up close it was not good, they should display fresh desserts every day, these looked like they had been sitting out for a few days, all soggy and melted, falling apart. Other than that, nothing else. Thanks but NO. Definitely need a redo on our Date Night !",

The last time we went, we got stuck in the back and it was not as enjoyable.\nThe food is always great, and the portions are large. The parking is kind of dicey. There is a parking lot across the street but sometimes it‚Äôs full and you have to find street parking down the street.",

The service was prompt and attentive without being a pain, thanks to bartender, James. I'll be back with family now that the weather is improving for outdoor seating.\n\nUPDATE\nThank goodness this place has a consistent kitchen! I usually come here during off hours because it's deservedly popular. I dropped below 180lbs since mid summer, so this is my go to for off diet splurging.\n\nLATEST UPDATE\nTroubling issues yesterday. The anticipated order of beef quesadillas came without sour cream to counter the sliced jalapeno and the guacamole was stale and off putting. After mentioning it to the bartender, she came back with the news that the kitchen was out of sour cream and yes, the guacamole was bad. She was attentive at least, finally a professional.\n\nOne problem I've always had here is the vanishing wait or bar staff. Until she waited on me ( she is the upstairs manager pressed into bartending for an absentee), the staff seemed to have never worked in a restaurant before, long waits for tea refills, no queries about sweetener or not and the worst, not checking to see if I was ready to pay. They would walk around and never look over to see if I'm done or need anything at all.\n\nDECEMBER 2023\nThe place was surprisingly festively decorated for Christmas, well done. The biggest improvement was the new ATTENTIVE bartender, no more waiting to order, waiting for refill inquiries and no more waiting for the bill to be presented. Plus, she was smiling often, no more dreary looking staff. As usual, the quesadillas were top shelf!",
