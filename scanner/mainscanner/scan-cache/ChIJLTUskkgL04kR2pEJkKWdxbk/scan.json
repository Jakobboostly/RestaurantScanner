So bland that if I had a blind fold on I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the difference between either of them. This used to be my favorite pizza place and it‚Äôs sucks to have watched it slowly go down hill. I thought I‚Äôd give them another shot but never again will I allow this pizza place to break my heart. :(",

It was our 6th pizza place on a Buffalo pizza tour and while we were absolutely full at the point of ordering at Deniro‚Äôs, we all really enjoyed the pizza they made. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and asked for it the be a little well done.\n\nThe crust was perfectly crispy, the sauce and cheese were delicious and the pepps they use are fantastic.\n\nOverall a very good pie and definitely recommend checking this place out.",

The 10 pizzas arrived pipping hot and both kids and parents loved it and only had 1 slice leftover which i ate on our way home.  Fantastic job to everyone working at Deniro's and we will definitely be adding them into our rotation because it's worth the drive!\nThanks again guys!\nSincerely,\nRob Badding Jr.",
