All the flavors come together to make something extraordinary.\n\nI eat here maybe 1 or 2 times a week. I am always greeted when walking in. After ordering and being around this welcoming place for a few weeks the service and atmosphere gets better and better. The restaurant is always clean.\n\nFrancis, Sergio and Von are always here when I order food. They took it upon themselves to memorize my order making it super easy for me to walk in and get my good started. They genuinely care about their guests and are doing an amazing job. I live 15 minutes away and my food is still hot when I get home. I will continue coming here with the service and care Francis, Sergio and Von continue to give.\n\nPS The food is amazing and I recommend trying a few different sauces every time to dial in what you really like.",

This was our first time here and it did not disappoint- it only made me wonder why I hadn‚Äôt been here sooner.\n\nThe menu is easy to understand and the ordering system is easy to follow. You order, pay, and then sit and wait for your food. We came on a Saturday night and there were maybe a handful of people ahead of us. There were three employees, only one was on the wok preparing the food. It looked understaffed.\n\nWe ended up waiting over 40 minutes for our food. When we got our food, I discovered that my order was incorrect. I took it up to the cashier and he said it was their mistake and they are understaffed. He said they would get my correct order out soon. I waited another 15 minutes or so for my correct order. The young man apologized for the wait, brought us some egg rolls and wontons, and said he was going to refund our order for the wait and mistakes. We really appreciated that and felt he handled the situation very well. I liked the ownership.\n\nI think the food is delicious. It‚Äôs fresh, flavorful, and I love the fact it‚Äôs made in an open kitchen and made to order. They have a lot of sauce options too. The portions are generous for the price. I can see myself coming here more often now that I know how great it is.\n\nI do wish, because it was about an hour or so wait total for my food, that they told you upfront how long the wait would be. I know and understand that a lot of small business are understaffed. I love supporting local but do wish there was some transparency upfront about the wait time. That‚Äôs all I would ask.",

A must experience! -2022\n\nUpdated 2025: Still one of our favorites for fresh food with fresh vegetables in a hurry. Why eat another burger when you can enjoy something like Wok the Line!!",

All the flavors come together to make something extraordinary.\n\nI eat here maybe 1 or 2 times a week. I am always greeted when walking in. After ordering and being around this welcoming place for a few weeks the service and atmosphere gets better and better. The restaurant is always clean.\n\nFrancis, Sergio and Von are always here when I order food. They took it upon themselves to memorize my order making it super easy for me to walk in and get my good started. They genuinely care about their guests and are doing an amazing job. I live 15 minutes away and my food is still hot when I get home. I will continue coming here with the service and care Francis, Sergio and Von continue to give.\n\nPS The food is amazing and I recommend trying a few different sauces every time to dial in what you really like.",
