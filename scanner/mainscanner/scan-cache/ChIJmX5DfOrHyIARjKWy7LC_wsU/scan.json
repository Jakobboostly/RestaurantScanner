Kinda old school decor but very clean looking.\nI ordered 2 cheese slices and got a drink too - it was 7.50 out the door, great price.\nGot 2 slices right out from the oven, using the Portnoy scale, i definitely rate this 8.4 or better.  Very nice char on bottom, crispy crust.  They must be using higher quality mozzarella, no grease.  Just enough sauce, with nice flavors.  Great chew to the slices.\nThe owner checked with me to make sure everything was good, it was great.\nI definitely will be back, will explore more of their menu.",

Their Italian and ranch dressing is excellent.",

Kinda old school decor but very clean looking.\nI ordered 2 cheese slices and got a drink too - it was 7.50 out the door, great price.\nGot 2 slices right out from the oven, using the Portnoy scale, i definitely rate this 8.4 or better.  Very nice char on bottom, crispy crust.  They must be using higher quality mozzarella, no grease.  Just enough sauce, with nice flavors.  Great chew to the slices.\nThe owner checked with me to make sure everything was good, it was great.\nI definitely will be back, will explore more of their menu.",

This is our second time visiting the restaurant, and they amazed us yet again!!\nThe veggie pizza was scrumptious, along with the cheese calzone and mozzarella sticks! Had an amazing time at this restaurant! Can‚Äôt wait to visit again next time we are here! The prices are affordable, and the service by the Frank family is lovely! They are so kind, and you can see their happiness while they are making the food! You must visit!! üòä",

Kinda old school decor but very clean looking.\nI ordered 2 cheese slices and got a drink too - it was 7.50 out the door, great price.\nGot 2 slices right out from the oven, using the Portnoy scale, i definitely rate this 8.4 or better.  Very nice char on bottom, crispy crust.  They must be using higher quality mozzarella, no grease.  Just enough sauce, with nice flavors.  Great chew to the slices.\nThe owner checked with me to make sure everything was good, it was great.\nI definitely will be back, will explore more of their menu.",

It was a little hard to see their menu but they waited patiently while we decided on what to order and we were greeted with a smile. After ordering you can see how they do everything made to order, served fresh and piping hot! Their restroom is small but well maintained. It was a wonderful experience dining in. They aren't afraid to have a little conversation or interact with their customers. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place if you are looking to relax and have a great slice of pizza!",

Kinda old school decor but very clean looking.\nI ordered 2 cheese slices and got a drink too - it was 7.50 out the door, great price.\nGot 2 slices right out from the oven, using the Portnoy scale, i definitely rate this 8.4 or better.  Very nice char on bottom, crispy crust.  They must be using higher quality mozzarella, no grease.  Just enough sauce, with nice flavors.  Great chew to the slices.\nThe owner checked with me to make sure everything was good, it was great.\nI definitely will be back, will explore more of their menu.",
