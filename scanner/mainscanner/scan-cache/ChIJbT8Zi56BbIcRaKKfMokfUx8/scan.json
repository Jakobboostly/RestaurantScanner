          "text": "Mici Italian absolutely delivers when it comes to fresh, satisfying Italian food with a homemade feel. I recently tried their meatballs, Caesar salad, and fettuccine Alfredo, and each dish stood out in its own way.\n\nThe meatballs were the star of the show tender, juicy, and full of flavor. You can tell they‚Äôre made from quality ingredients, and the house marinara sauce they‚Äôre served with is rich and perfectly balanced. It‚Äôs the kind of comfort food that hits just right.\n\nThe Caesar salad was crisp and refreshing, with a generous amount of shaved Parmesan and crunchy croutons. The dressing had that classic creamy tang without being too heavy just enough to coat the romaine perfectly.\n\nThe fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and indulgent without being overly rich. The pasta was cooked just right, and the sauce was smooth with a nice buttery finish. It‚Äôs a simple dish, but Mici executes it beautifully.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was casual and welcoming great for a relaxed meal with family or friends.\n\nIf you‚Äôre craving comforting Italian classics that feel both homemade and high-quality, Mici Italian is a solid choice.",

          "text": "My first time trying any Mici Italian. I loved how the counter person took time to explain everything on the menu. That made my ordering a little easier.  Each table had a little vase with fresh cut flowers. The attention to detail in these two areas ia nice. The garlic bread is a mini cibatta roll which is also great-yummy bread. The spaghetti and marinara was pretty good. The downfall is the price. $4.69 to add chicken to a $14.00 entree is a little ridiculous when the chicken is scarce and clearly not fresh. It's pre- packaged chicken in precut slices that tasted bland and almost had a watery texture or consistency.  I wish the chicken were fresher and not so processed.  Another downfall is the fact that they serve Alfredo and Primavera, but do not offer linguine or fettuccine style noodles which are traditionally the noodles type that go with those sauces. I had to get spaghetti with the Alfredo which was the closest they had.  I think the flavor is there, but these things threw me off. Might stick with Noodles and Company next time which is right next door. Probably a better bang for your buck and more pasta choices. I would come back and sample some of their other menu items. It's a nice place overall.",

Each table had a little vase with fresh cut flowers. The attention to detail in these two areas ia nice. The garlic bread is a mini cibatta roll which is also great-yummy bread. The spaghetti and marinara was pretty good. The downfall is the price. $4.69 to add chicken to a $14.00 entree is a little ridiculous when the chicken is scarce and clearly not fresh. It's pre- packaged chicken in precut slices that tasted bland and almost had a watery texture or consistency.  I wish the chicken were fresher and not so processed.  Another downfall is the fact that they serve Alfredo and Primavera, but do not offer linguine or fettuccine style noodles which are traditionally the noodles type that go with those sauces. I had to get spaghetti with the Alfredo which was the closest they had.  I think the flavor is there, but these things threw me off. Might stick with Noodles and Company next time which is right next door. Probably a better bang for your buck and more pasta choices. I would come back and sample some of their other menu items. It's a nice place overall.",

          "text": "Mici Italian absolutely delivers when it comes to fresh, satisfying Italian food with a homemade feel. I recently tried their meatballs, Caesar salad, and fettuccine Alfredo, and each dish stood out in its own way.\n\nThe meatballs were the star of the show tender, juicy, and full of flavor. You can tell they‚Äôre made from quality ingredients, and the house marinara sauce they‚Äôre served with is rich and perfectly balanced. It‚Äôs the kind of comfort food that hits just right.\n\nThe Caesar salad was crisp and refreshing, with a generous amount of shaved Parmesan and crunchy croutons. The dressing had that classic creamy tang without being too heavy just enough to coat the romaine perfectly.\n\nThe fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and indulgent without being overly rich. The pasta was cooked just right, and the sauce was smooth with a nice buttery finish. It‚Äôs a simple dish, but Mici executes it beautifully.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was casual and welcoming great for a relaxed meal with family or friends.\n\nIf you‚Äôre craving comforting Italian classics that feel both homemade and high-quality, Mici Italian is a solid choice.",

Their 10\" pizza w/ a fountain drink for $10 (at least this was the deal when I went there) is by far the best thing on this planet. I got a margarita pizza, not expecting too much- but this blew me away. The perfectly crunchy pizza, with the fresh marinara, and the perfect balance of cheese~ you have no idea.\n\nOn top of having incredible food, the staff are super nice (Even giving a friend of mine a free drink), respectful, and patient!\n\nGenuinely, this is probably my favorite restaurant of all time. If there was a way to give a 10/5 star rating, I would give them a billion out of five.",

Each table had a little vase with fresh cut flowers. The attention to detail in these two areas ia nice. The garlic bread is a mini cibatta roll which is also great-yummy bread. The spaghetti and marinara was pretty good. The downfall is the price. $4.69 to add chicken to a $14.00 entree is a little ridiculous when the chicken is scarce and clearly not fresh. It's pre- packaged chicken in precut slices that tasted bland and almost had a watery texture or consistency.  I wish the chicken were fresher and not so processed.  Another downfall is the fact that they serve Alfredo and Primavera, but do not offer linguine or fettuccine style noodles which are traditionally the noodles type that go with those sauces. I had to get spaghetti with the Alfredo which was the closest they had.  I think the flavor is there, but these things threw me off. Might stick with Noodles and Company next time which is right next door. Probably a better bang for your buck and more pasta choices. I would come back and sample some of their other menu items. It's a nice place overall.",
