I ordered two large pizzas and one medium, but when I arrived to pick up my order, I was handed one large and two medium pizzas. When I questioned it, the girl at the counter went to speak with the pizza guy, and instead of making it right, they simply took one of the medium pizzas out of their box and put it into a large box.  I was told the pizzas were just “in the wrong size boxes,” but when I got home and opened them, it was obvious — I had three medium pizzas, even though I paid $70 for two large and one medium.\n\nTo make matters worse, all three pizzas were undercooked. This isn’t the first time I’ve ordered from here, and I used to really like this place, but the combination of DISHONESTY and poor quality was incredibly disappointing. Sadly, I can’t see myself coming back",

I ordered two large pizzas and one medium, but when I arrived to pick up my order, I was handed one large and two medium pizzas. When I questioned it, the girl at the counter went to speak with the pizza guy, and instead of making it right, they simply took one of the medium pizzas out of their box and put it into a large box.  I was told the pizzas were just “in the wrong size boxes,” but when I got home and opened them, it was obvious — I had three medium pizzas, even though I paid $70 for two large and one medium.\n\nTo make matters worse, all three pizzas were undercooked. This isn’t the first time I’ve ordered from here, and I used to really like this place, but the combination of DISHONESTY and poor quality was incredibly disappointing. Sadly, I can’t see myself coming back",

Needless to say that we never finished our entrée because of all the stuff we ate before that. Been there many times before, been there last week and will definitely going back again soon.",

My child LOVES pasta and she barely even touched it. The spagetti and SINGULAR giant meatball from the kids menu was trash. its like the chef had leftover cat paté, formed it into a giant meatball and served that on a platter. We also ordered a margarita pizza… when i tell you i have never had pizza that bad the mozzarella was flavorless, rubbery and not the way it should be and the sauce i swear had NO FLAVOR!! i took one bite and just gave up honestly the kind waitress asked if i needed a box i’ve never been so quick to say NO i literally left an entire pizza behind a complete waste of money AND food. and one last note the floor under my table was so oily you could tell it was not cleaned properly. i genuinely hope they take this as constructive criticism because olive garden should not be better than a authentic Italian restaurant",

It used to be my absolute favorite but my past few orders have had issues.\n\nI ordered chicken piccata, and the chicken itself was OK, but they gave me a side of pasta with marinara sauce on it. Why in the world would you not put the piccata sauce on the pasta as well?\n\nMy most recent order was baked ziti,  I requested extra sauce, and this definitely did not have extra sauce. The garlic rolls are completely dry. There’s absolutely no butter on them at all.\n\nThe girl working the counter was rude to the customer before me, and while not outright rude to me, was pretty unpleasant.\n\nunfortunately, it seems that this restaurant no longer has the quality and service that they used to have, and I probably won’t be going back.",

It was over 22.00.\nWhen she handed me the pizza, it was so light I held it by the side of the box with 1 hand. I get home open the box.\nThe sauce and cheese started 2 inches from the crust all the way around.. A medium pizza on a large doe. It was light sauce and light cheese. No substance.\nThe worst.  I wish I took a picture of it.\nFerros is gone way down hill.\nMr. And Mrs. Ferro ran a consistant abundant resturant.\nI don't know who's running it now, but don't waste your money or time on Ferros.

          "text": "This is my Revised Review: Ferros Pizza did address the issue regarding the Sub Dressing. I still order there frequently, as they are very conveniently located to me, the subs are big and delicious, as well as their other menu items, and service and friendliness is always good.\n\nPrevious Review: Ordered a 12 inch sub, dressing on the side. It came with less than 1oz of oil/vinaigrette. I asked for another 1/2 filled 2oz souffle cup of oil/vinegar and they made me pay $1.49 cents on my credit card. I order from Ferros 2-3 times a week. They are located behind my house. HOWEVER!!! The nickel and diming that they have implemented recently is not good. I have been a regular customer for the past 9 years. I guess they do not know that it is more difficult to get a NEW Customer than to keep the ones that you already have.. Business 101. P.S. I do NOT enjoy writing any negative reviews at all. But I think this kind of thing needs to be brought to ownership's attention. I mean..... at least fill up a 2oz cup all the way. Why waste the plastic souffle cup by only filling it 1/2 way??",

Overall not bad in a pinch because they did provide my special request,  but it wasn't anything to write home about. Was recommended highly by a friend that goes often, so to each their own on taste.

We had their delicious garlic rolls, and they're fried calamari, and then we all have different dishes. First of all the service was fantastic. Before we could even ask for more water or could you get me this and that it was already sent to the table. My food was exceptional. I am Italian American I'm very fussy about going to eat Italian food. I ordered the seafood dish with Linguini and I cannot even tell you how this masterpiece came out and how delicious it was. First of all they give such amazing amount of food and the seafood was delicious the pasta was delicious and cooked perfect and I was so pleased I couldn't wait to tell the owner. I looked at all the dishes that came out for the family, and each one had such an amazing amount of food and was so put in the dishes so well and looks so appetizing, and everyone was satisfied with the food. Sometimes you go to a restaurant and when the dish comes out it looks like they shared it with somebody else because the prices are high and the amount in the dishes is very small. That does not happen in Ferro's. The seafood in my dish was so well cooked, not overcooked and delicious with the amount of seasoning.... just perfectly done. My daughter had the eggplant parmesan it was delicious and also an amazing amount done so perfectly and looked so delicious when it came out we all said \"oh wow look at that\" we have gone there for pizza and their Pizza is really good, and does not make you hesitate to call them for delivery or to go there and sit down and enjoy a delicious pizza. Now you see why I want to call it delicious because everything in there is really good. I am very \"Picky,\" and cannot wait to go back again!Thank You Ferros for making my granddaughter's birthday dinner something special. I come from Miami Lakes area and don't mind doing the driving to come back there at all. Hope to see you really soon Tony... if I close my eyes and just eat there and feels like I'm eating in Brooklyn New York where I come from originally. Lenore Croce",

My son asked me to order a medium cheese pizza and an order of fried calamari. I called, I placed the order. For my surprise the total  amount was  $39+ wow, thank goodness I didn’t add a topping of pepperoni as my son asked me to, knowing that I like it on my pizza. My son is leaving for the US Army and we just trying to enjoy every single moment we can before he leaves.  Ferro really surprised us. I understand inflation, but eating outside is an option .",

I ordered two large pizzas and one medium, but when I arrived to pick up my order, I was handed one large and two medium pizzas. When I questioned it, the girl at the counter went to speak with the pizza guy, and instead of making it right, they simply took one of the medium pizzas out of their box and put it into a large box.  I was told the pizzas were just “in the wrong size boxes,” but when I got home and opened them, it was obvious — I had three medium pizzas, even though I paid $70 for two large and one medium.\n\nTo make matters worse, all three pizzas were undercooked. This isn’t the first time I’ve ordered from here, and I used to really like this place, but the combination of DISHONESTY and poor quality was incredibly disappointing.

My child LOVES pasta and she barely even touched it. The spagetti and SINGULAR giant meatball from the kids menu was trash. its like the chef had leftover cat paté, formed it into a giant meatball and served that on a platter. We also ordered a margarita pizza… when i tell you i have never had pizza that bad the mozzarella was flavorless, rubbery and not the way it should be and the sauce i swear had NO FLAVOR!! i took one bite and just gave up honestly the kind waitress asked if i needed a box i’ve never been so quick to say NO i literally left an entire pizza behind a complete waste of money AND food. and one last note the floor under my table was so oily you could tell it was not cleaned properly. i genuinely hope they take this as constructive criticism because olive garden should not be better than a authentic Italian restaurant",
