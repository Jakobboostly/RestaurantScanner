Was very pleasantly surprised at the good food we got. The portion was very generous and one of the few times could not eat my entire hamburger. Also got the spudilicious fries, and wow those were good. Service was quite slow being the only customer at the moment, but was worth the wait. A must try.  Requiring a tip for ordering my food at the counter, seating myself, and cleaning up for myself is always a sore spot. #notipfornoservice and always drops my score a tad. The price was well within reason .",

Was very pleasantly surprised at the good food we got. The portion was very generous and one of the few times could not eat my entire hamburger. Also got the spudilicious fries, and wow those were good. Service was quite slow being the only customer at the moment, but was worth the wait. A must try.  Requiring a tip for ordering my food at the counter, seating myself, and cleaning up for myself is always a sore spot. #notipfornoservice and always drops my score a tad.

Their service is excellent and this has become one of our top favorite places!\n\nWe were going to rate them 4 stars because they said it would be 12-15 minutes and it took 30, but their food was just too dang good!! My wife and I ordered the Meat Man and the Johnny and split it and it was the best decision we had made in weeks. Both of them were so good!! The fries were cut in a way I've never seen before but they were perfectly cooked and salted so they were amazing too! The price was higher than most burger places we go to, but it was comparable in price to Cafe Rio and Mo Betta's (two of our other favorites) and it tasted better than either of them. Highly recommend!",

The Spudlicious fries were honestly mid. Throw some pulled pork on them and they‚Äôd be fire though, sheeeesh. The restaurant itself is lacking in that it‚Äôs inside of a food-hall shared with other restaurants, thus lacking some identity.

I got The Outlaw, which was equally huge. The sauce that's on the burger is so good. The burgers do not come with fries, but for $3 you get a decent side of fries. We shared the fries and couldn't finish them. They come with fry sauce that has some seasoning in it. The fries are probably some of the best fries we've ever had! We order two beers and due to whatever rules Utah has for them they can't serve the beer in the bottle, so it came in a red solo cup. Could be due to the food court atmosphere and kids being around? I don't know. The gentleman that helped us was really nice and helped me decide on a burger. He was friendly and had great conversation. All in all we loved it and will be back to try other burgers!",
