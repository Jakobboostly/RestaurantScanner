It took an additional 15 minutes to bring a coffee and a juice, and an additional 45 minutes for our food to arrive. We had four tables around get up and leave while arguing with the owner.\n\nI was excited once it finally came, having decided to stick it out in hopes it would be worth it all, but was horribly disappointed at cold food that had been dying in the window.\n\nI do not recommend at this time.",

We are here visiting a patient at Cleveland clinic & decided to take time out of an already long sad day to grab a bite. We had heard great things about Urban Kitchen so was excited to check it out. We are immediately greeted by the staff and sat down. Server comes to the table we chat about the menu and put in our order. We got a quesadilla for the app and 2 entrees. All the food comes out together, strange. We bring it to the servers attention, he offers to keep our entrees hot on the line, we declined. My aunt previously asked for extra sauce when she placed her order but the food came without it. We had to wait 7-10 mins before the server came back to let him know about the sauce. At this point the food is cold. We brought all of this to their attention and mind you there was a clear attitude. We asked to speak with a manger, apparently no manager on duty. Strange. My thing is you all are a restaurant next to a hospital. Most of your business probably comes from that campus. Have empathy, have a better attitude, have better hospitality. You should have that anyway as a restaurant but even more so because of the location. We come to Cleveland clinic quite often and we will never come back to this establishment.

We are here visiting a patient at Cleveland clinic & decided to take time out of an already long sad day to grab a bite. We had heard great things about Urban Kitchen so was excited to check it out. We are immediately greeted by the staff and sat down. Server comes to the table we chat about the menu and put in our order. We got a quesadilla for the app and 2 entrees. All the food comes out together, strange. We bring it to the servers attention, he offers to keep our entrees hot on the line, we declined. My aunt previously asked for extra sauce when she placed her order but the food came without it. We had to wait 7-10 mins before the server came back to let him know about the sauce. At this point the food is cold. We brought all of this to their attention and mind you there was a clear attitude. We asked to speak with a manger, apparently no manager on duty. Strange. My thing is you all are a restaurant next to a hospital. Most of your business probably comes from that campus. Have empathy, have a better attitude, have better hospitality. You should have that anyway as a restaurant but even more so because of the location. We come to Cleveland clinic quite often and we will never come back to this establishment. Control your attitude.",

I had the salmon burger with fries with a Hibiscus drink, everything was so good. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good place to eat that's affordable and you get what you pay for! Like everyone said in the previous reviews, they are generous with portions.

We had four tables around get up and leave while arguing with the owner.\n\nI was excited once it finally came, having decided to stick it out in hopes it would be worth it all, but was horribly disappointed at cold food that had been dying in the window.\n\nI do not recommend at this time.",

No idea what the issue was; no explanation given.  Food was average. One of the guests in our party asked for no cheese on the sandwich, but it was still served with cheese.  Not impressed.

Chicken was moist and fall off the bone with the green sauce (soup?) that was herbaceous and delicious.  Mashawi was a delight of flavors on an open bread. The peppers were grilled into smoky candy because they brought out all the natural sugars. The meats were delightful and went with the garlic sauce perfectly.\n\nThis is my third time through Cleveland recently and third time eating here. Love it!!\n\nOh and the okra stew is just the best!!!!!",

We are here visiting a patient at Cleveland clinic & decided to take time out of an already long sad day to grab a bite. We had heard great things about Urban Kitchen so was excited to check it out. We are immediately greeted by the staff and sat down. Server comes to the table we chat about the menu and put in our order. We got a quesadilla for the app and 2 entrees. All the food comes out together, strange. We bring it to the servers attention, he offers to keep our entrees hot on the line, we declined. My aunt previously asked for extra sauce when she placed her order but the food came without it. We had to wait 7-10 mins before the server came back to let him know about the sauce. At this point the food is cold. We brought all of this to their attention and mind you there was a clear attitude. We asked to speak with a manger, apparently no manager on duty. Strange. My thing is you all are a restaurant next to a hospital. Most of your business probably comes from that campus. Have empathy, have a better attitude, have better hospitality. You should have that anyway as a restaurant but even more so because of the location. We come to Cleveland clinic quite often and we will never come back to this establishment. Control your attitude.",
