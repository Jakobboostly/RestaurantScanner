Let me tell you they‚Äôre special on Saturday supposed to be too large 14 inch one item pizza plus breadsticks. We also got two large chef Salads. My wife ordered a pepperoni pizza as I ordered a taco meat pizza. Her pizza was delicious. Good amount of pepperonis on it. You get to my pizza with taco meat on it basically I ordered I guess was a cheese pizza made about five piece Taco meat on the whole pizza! Then on the salads, both of the lettuce were a lot of brown. The salami was not cut no tomatoes on a chef Salad that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Also, I added banana peppers on my salad. I got two paid $.50 for two pieces of banana pepper another $.50 to add a sour cream that was disgusting. Thank God I smelled it before I put it on my salad. We will not be coming back here for a quite a long time if ever very disappointing!",

With delivery fee it came to $18. I have previously ordered italian subs that were $11 no issue. I got a call telling me I had to order $6 more food to meet the minimum delivery. No where online does it state this. I asked her why because I never had to before and she said there has always been a minimum. She asked the manager why, then came back and said it was because they had other orders going my way. This is unacceptable and I should have cancelled my order. So instead of it costing me $22 (with tip because not drivers fault) its now over $30 for one person! Then to top it off the garlic cheese bread was not done and my sub was cold. They just lost a customer, as I will never order from them again.",

We show up at 6:50 and it's not ready because they forgot to apparently check their online orders? Unclear. The kid at checkout was frazzled. We paid for a two topping (pepperoni and double cheese) pizza and received only burnt in the middle cheese pizza. It takes five seconds for a staff member to check the ticket and the toppings on the pizza before boxing it up. We didn't realize until we got home otherwise we would have had them fix it then and did not want to drive back out. I guess we will no longer be online ordering on the weekends anymore.",

Not what we ordered.\n\nThis was the saddest example of a pizza I have ever had delivered.  It was burnt, had more dough bubbles than cheese showing (cheese was sprayed on it was so thin) and the box weighed more than the pizza.\n\nIt is easy to see why this once great place to grab a pie has gone to trash.

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!!!! Pray they get your order right because if someon messes up they will not fix it or give you a refund back so your stuck with what you did not order. Then when you ask to make it right they tell you to never order from us again.. wow what a waste of restaurant..... Update 3/12/24 decided to give them another shot ordered online I put my address in correctly because I looked at the address twice before hitting summit. Somehow computer glitch and the order went to a tanning salon. The driver should have asked for the person and no one is there by that name they should have called the number because that‚Äôs why we give them our numbers right??? Well I called Paynes and the manager was rude as hell to me told me it was my fault I put the address wrong no I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ so my $30.00 went out the window. Wouldn‚Äôt even remake my food and send it to the correct address no he would not.",

I would not pay $24.50 for two sandwiches! Then he goes to his car comes back and wants me to pay for it and he will go get it and be back within the hour! No thanks! I sent the sandwiches back with him and told him we would not be ordering anymore! I had just told them on the phone I keep asking for pepperoni in my salad, being charged for it but it's not there!

I especially like the removal of the wall by the order and pick up counters. Same great pizza! // Update: Dropping one star 07-27-24. We picked up an order and discovered it was incorrect when we arrived home. Called and they verified it was incorrect based on the order in their system. Payne's refused to bring the correct order to us. Bad customer service in our opinion.",

Let me tell you they‚Äôre special on Saturday supposed to be too large 14 inch one item pizza plus breadsticks. We also got two large chef Salads. My wife ordered a pepperoni pizza as I ordered a taco meat pizza. Her pizza was delicious. Good amount of pepperonis on it. You get to my pizza with taco meat on it basically I ordered I guess was a cheese pizza made about five piece Taco meat on the whole pizza! Then on the salads, both of the lettuce were a lot of brown. The salami was not cut no tomatoes on a chef Salad that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Also, I added banana peppers on my salad. I got two paid $.50 for two pieces of banana pepper another $.50 to add a sour cream that was disgusting. Thank God I smelled it before I put it on my salad. We will not be coming back here for a quite a long time if ever very disappointing!",
