I got to try out their plain cheese pizza.\n\nIt was solid. Nothing too exceptional really but not bad. The sauce is a little sweet but not excessively so. As I mentioned, it is doughy, but I think their dough quality is a little above the average in the area. Their portion sizes are pretty great and the food is super reasonably priced. This would be a great pizza for game day or a relaxed weekend.\n\nAll in all, nice spot for pie. They also have some more interesting pizza styles, like Mediterranean and such. I would go back to try those, but even with the basics, prices and portions are good.",

The pizza is consistently delicious, with the crust being not too chewy and not too crisp -- it's actually just right!  We've tried several different topping combinations, and they always seem to do them with care.  Mushrooms and onions are fresh -- which is a big deal since many other places cut corners on freshness.  They have some interesting -- and good -- gourmet topping combinations as well.  We also like the gyros.  They are always friendly and have come to recognize me.  Parking is also very convenient since it sits right next to the old Port Authority Millvale \"bus loop\" which is now a parking lot.  This has become a regular, go to place for us, which is very nice.",

A quarter of the way through I opened the bread and the breading on the chicken was almost white and when I tried a piece of it by itself it tasted awful so that's what made it taste bad, not the sauce.

I got to try out their plain cheese pizza.\n\nIt was solid. Nothing too exceptional really but not bad. The sauce is a little sweet but not excessively so. As I mentioned, it is doughy, but I think their dough quality is a little above the average in the area. Their portion sizes are pretty great and the food is super reasonably priced. This would be a great pizza for game day or a relaxed weekend.\n\nAll in all, nice spot for pie. They also have some more interesting pizza styles, like Mediterranean and such. I would go back to try those, but even with the basics, prices and portions are good.",

The $14.99\nLarge 1 topping pizza can feed 3 people (currently it is very hard to feed 3 people for just $15). with average appetites, and so my wife and I, always have some pizza left over.  We‚Äôve their Red Sauce pizzas, several times, but our favorite is the White Pizza with Sliced Tomatoes as the topping.  The perfect amount of garlic to make for a perfect pizza.

I got to try out their plain cheese pizza.\n\nIt was solid. Nothing too exceptional really but not bad. The sauce is a little sweet but not excessively so. As I mentioned, it is doughy, but I think their dough quality is a little above the average in the area. Their portion sizes are pretty great and the food is super reasonably priced. This would be a great pizza for game day or a relaxed weekend.\n\nAll in all, nice spot for pie. They also have some more interesting pizza styles, like Mediterranean and such. I would go back to try those, but even with the basics, prices and portions are good.",
