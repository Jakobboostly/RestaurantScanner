I'm very happy with my experience here.\n\nedit to review. I have really liked going to this place for some time, but my experience yesterday really turned me away from the place. I went in though the drive though, normally it takes only a few minutes, this time I spent close to 25-30 minutes there. when I ordered the person seemed really snappy, though that may have just been my perception of it. finally when i got my food, absolutely everything was wrong with it, i got lime chicken with Spanish rice and balsamic vinaigrette, the only thing they got right in it was the chicken which was insanely dry compared to previous times.\nI was on my work lunch and by the time i noticed they gave me everything wrong I had no time to go back and correct it. for the time waiting, the food gotten and the snappy server, i felt really disappointed in a place I have really loved so far. IDK if they have recently hired a lot of new people recently, but i think there needs to be some additional training or at least a double check the order.",

The burritos are exquisite, and you definitely have to give their shrimp tacos a try. At Bajio, everyone knows your name. Although Francisco and Raymond don‚Äôt work there anymore (they are missed), it is the best food ever. Would absolutely recommend.",
