It‚Äôs as if you entered into a small Italy town.\n\nTheir pizza ranges from small to the largest pizza you'd have ever seen... 24+ inches.\n\nCame with my family here and ordered 4 medium (14 inches), unique pizzas. Each looked better than the other.\n\nWhen we started separating each slice the melted cheese kept getting longer the more you pulled the slice.\n\nWe had Cimino's Deluxe, Spaghetti Pizza, Taco Pizza and Cheese Pizza. Everything tasted delicious.  We couldn't even finish everything.\n\nOur waitress was such a great personality and great sense of humor. Highly recommend Cimino's Little Italy.",

It‚Äôs as if you entered into a small Italy town.\n\nTheir pizza ranges from small to the largest pizza you'd have ever seen... 24+ inches.\n\nCame with my family here and ordered 4 medium (14 inches), unique pizzas. Each looked better than the other.\n\nWhen we started separating each slice the melted cheese kept getting longer the more you pulled the slice.\n\nWe had Cimino's Deluxe, Spaghetti Pizza, Taco Pizza and Cheese Pizza. Everything tasted delicious.  We couldn't even finish everything.\n\nOur waitress was such a great personality and great sense of humor. Highly recommend Cimino's Little Italy.",
