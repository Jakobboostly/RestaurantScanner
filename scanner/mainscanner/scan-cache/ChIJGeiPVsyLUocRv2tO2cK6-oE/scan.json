          "text": "I was exploring Reddit for the best pizza in Utah, and Victor's Pizza Co continually topped people's list, so I had to give it a try. We ordered a 14\" Royale with Cheese, a 16\" half Chopper and half Mia, a 12\" Taj Mahal, 6 pcs Mango Habanero Chicken Wings, 6pcs Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings, and a \"You Never Can Tell\" Raspberry Pie. For the record, the raspberry dessert pie was an over-the-moon highlight for us. The whole family fought over every slice, so I highly recommend. All the pizzas were excellent. The general consensus was individuals tended to favor the pie they had requested, and only liked the pies they hadn't. So trust your eyes and your gut when ordering and you'll land a home run. For me, the Chopper was #1, and I plan on ordering The Gimp, Honey Bunny, Marvin, and Bad Mother Clucker on future visits. The wings are good and meaty, but the Spicy Buffalo had no spice. Still good, but zero heat. I enjoyed the heat and flavor from the Mango Habanero though. Did I mention the raspberry pie? Seriously, you've got to add it to your order. I'm still having food dreams about it.\n\nThe staff here are phenomenal. If I was a recruiter seeking customer service staff, I'd pull directly from the employees at Victor's. I called my order in, and the gal on the phone was friendly, helpful, and went out of her way to get me a good deal. I really appreciated her going above and beyond. Picking up the pizza in store was equally as good of an experience.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome. I love the decor, and wish I could've eaten in house (although the A/C was out so maybe it was better I couldn't this time round). The only negative is parking. I'm still not sure where you're supposed to park, but I snagged a spot at the restaurant next door for a quick pickup.\n\nVictor's Pizza Co is an awesome pizza spot and I love the local business. It's a pricier place for pizza, especially compared to the big chains, but it's quality and filling so you get your bang for your buck. Now that I've found Victor's, I'll continue to darken their doors and keep their ovens firing.",

It is phenomenal pizza and some of the best cheese bread I've ever had, it has more garlic than most places and it's fantastic. A lot of the toppings were hiding under the cheese, so the there's more than meets the eye initially, yum!\n\nThe style of pizza reminds me of a small hometown mom and pop kind of pizza place and it is delicious!",

The guy in charge was short staffed, basically cooking, running food and maybe the register. I was injured and he brought my pizza curbside with utensils, napkins and plates. That was so nice. I drove home; my friend and I sat down for a slice. The cheese pizza was perfect. It was extra toasted, just the way we like it. The cheese was bubbly, gooey, and crispy in the best parts. Oh my gosh! The red SAUCE is fabulous! It has the right amount of spice in it. Sweet, tangy, and cooked just right. A plain cheese pizza is the best way to try the sauce because it's the sauce that makes it taste so good!!",

          "text": "I was exploring Reddit for the best pizza in Utah, and Victor's Pizza Co continually topped people's list, so I had to give it a try. We ordered a 14\" Royale with Cheese, a 16\" half Chopper and half Mia, a 12\" Taj Mahal, 6 pcs Mango Habanero Chicken Wings, 6pcs Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wings, and a \"You Never Can Tell\" Raspberry Pie. For the record, the raspberry dessert pie was an over-the-moon highlight for us. The whole family fought over every slice, so I highly recommend. All the pizzas were excellent. The general consensus was individuals tended to favor the pie they had requested, and only liked the pies they hadn't. So trust your eyes and your gut when ordering and you'll land a home run. For me, the Chopper was #1, and I plan on ordering The Gimp, Honey Bunny, Marvin, and Bad Mother Clucker on future visits. The wings are good and meaty, but the Spicy Buffalo had no spice. Still good, but zero heat. I enjoyed the heat and flavor from the Mango Habanero though. Did I mention the raspberry pie? Seriously, you've got to add it to your order. I'm still having food dreams about it.\n\nThe staff here are phenomenal. If I was a recruiter seeking customer service staff, I'd pull directly from the employees at Victor's. I called my order in, and the gal on the phone was friendly, helpful, and went out of her way to get me a good deal. I really appreciated her going above and beyond. Picking up the pizza in store was equally as good of an experience.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome. I love the decor, and wish I could've eaten in house (although the A/C was out so maybe it was better I couldn't this time round). The only negative is parking. I'm still not sure where you're supposed to park, but I snagged a spot at the restaurant next door for a quick pickup.\n\nVictor's Pizza Co is an awesome pizza spot and I love the local business. It's a pricier place for pizza, especially compared to the big chains, but it's quality and filling so you get your bang for your buck. Now that I've found Victor's, I'll continue to darken their doors and keep their ovens firing.",

I have great sympathy for the employees. Next to those ovens, it must be exhausting. Some somple fans would solve the problem. Its not a big space. Would definitely order another pizza from there.",

The owner was friendly, the place had a free arcade game, and there were two tv‚Äôs, one playing Adventure Time and the other Breaking Bad. Overall a great vibe.\nAnd now for the food, the chicken wings were ü§åüèºchef‚Äôs kiss üòö. I love chicken wings and have been desperately looking for a good place in Salt Lake. Mango habanero is the way to go! Pizza was phenomenal too!! I got the Marvin and my boyfriend got the Wolf.\nThe ingredients tasted fresh and I‚Äôm a sucker for a good crust and sauce. Highly recommend.\nJust a heads up to call ahead or be patient since it is a smaller local business. So wait times may be a little longer depending on how busy they get.",

And next thing you know I'm getting a call from the manager cuz he was 5 min from my house with a new pizza and he added a drink. That's how business is done the pizza is the best in the valley if not the country and I've been around. I will never get pizza anywhere else I don't know the managers name but believe I won't ever forget the dashers name",

The pizza was loaded with cheese and toppings so every bite had something on it. I originally wanted to dine in but the atmosphere was suffocating. It was humid and hot. I have great sympathy for the employees. Next to those ovens, it must be exhausting. Some somple fans would solve the problem. Its not a big space. Would definitely order another pizza from there.",
