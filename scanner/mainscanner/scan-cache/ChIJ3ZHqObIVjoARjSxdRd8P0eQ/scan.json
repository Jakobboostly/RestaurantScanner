          "text": "As a family that truly loves Italian cuisine, we‚Äôve visited countless Italian restaurants in various regions. Buzzo Wood Fired Pizza immediately impressed us with its modern, stylish interior and its open kitchen ‚Äî a design choice that suggested both culinary transparency and a commitment to cleanliness. It set the stage for high expectations.\n\nYet, upon entering, there was an inexplicable sense of unease. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint whether it stemmed from the service itself or the overall atmosphere, but the warmth and friendliness we often appreciate in a dining experience felt somewhat absent.\n\nFor our mains, we ordered The Charlie Pizza and The Jenkins Pizza. The Charlie Pizza was, unfortunately, far too salty. A touch of saltiness can enhance flavor, but in this case, it overpowered the dish and made it difficult to enjoy. The Jenkins Pizza, featuring jalape√±os for a bit of spice, was fine but lacked any particularly memorable or distinctive character.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, however, came in the form of the appetizer: Arancini. These crispy, golden risotto balls, served with a parmesan sauce and leek oil, were exceptional. The contrast of the crunchy exterior and creamy risotto center, paired with the rich and aromatic sauces, was superb ‚Äî easily redeeming the shortcomings of the pizzas we ordered.\n\nIn the end, Buzzo Wood Fired Pizza shows great potential, with a stylish setting and certain dishes that shine. A warmer, more welcoming service experience and better balance in the pizza seasoning could elevate it into a truly outstanding destination.",

I had heard a lot of great things about Buzzo's before finally getting an opportunity to eat here, so was really hopeful. Definitely see why people like it! The crust is damn near perfect, and the arancini was wonderful.\n\nThe better pizza was definitely the margherita. I had heard a lot about the potato pizza, but to me it just didn't really seem to work; there were so many ingredients and it just didn't meld well to me.\n\nNeither pizza had the marbling on the cheese I was hoping for, but definitely overall a really solid experience! Would come back for sure!",

They toasted the bread perfectly to go with it and the ricotta added on top was soo delicious!\nThe arancini that people seemed to rage about wasn't really special to me personally. The filling was a bit bland and the sauce wasn't anything too crazy. Just your typical arancini.\nFor this place being a pizza place, the pizza that we received was a 6/10 for me. The crust was spectacular. Very soft yet chewy, it felt like a warm mochi. The flavor was overall good but I don't like my pizza wet.\nThe waitress was very sweet and nice. It was busy for a Thursday night. She came and checked up on us three times during their rush asking how everything is.\nThe ambiance and service got me enjoying my stay here.",

          "text": "As a family that truly loves Italian cuisine, we‚Äôve visited countless Italian restaurants in various regions. Buzzo Wood Fired Pizza immediately impressed us with its modern, stylish interior and its open kitchen ‚Äî a design choice that suggested both culinary transparency and a commitment to cleanliness. It set the stage for high expectations.\n\nYet, upon entering, there was an inexplicable sense of unease. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint whether it stemmed from the service itself or the overall atmosphere, but the warmth and friendliness we often appreciate in a dining experience felt somewhat absent.\n\nFor our mains, we ordered The Charlie Pizza and The Jenkins Pizza. The Charlie Pizza was, unfortunately, far too salty. A touch of saltiness can enhance flavor, but in this case, it overpowered the dish and made it difficult to enjoy. The Jenkins Pizza, featuring jalape√±os for a bit of spice, was fine but lacked any particularly memorable or distinctive character.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, however, came in the form of the appetizer: Arancini. These crispy, golden risotto balls, served with a parmesan sauce and leek oil, were exceptional. The contrast of the crunchy exterior and creamy risotto center, paired with the rich and aromatic sauces, was superb ‚Äî easily redeeming the shortcomings of the pizzas we ordered.\n\nIn the end, Buzzo Wood Fired Pizza shows great potential, with a stylish setting and certain dishes that shine. A warmer, more welcoming service experience and better balance in the pizza seasoning could elevate it into a truly outstanding destination.",

Caesar salad was gooey.  Rita choices‚Ä¶.ultra sweet but waiter brought extra lemon juice (nice).  Olives were good.  Meatballs very good.  So much room for improvement on this simple, but very hard-to-interpret menu.\nAnd pretty pricey!",

          "text": "As a family that truly loves Italian cuisine, we‚Äôve visited countless Italian restaurants in various regions. Buzzo Wood Fired Pizza immediately impressed us with its modern, stylish interior and its open kitchen ‚Äî a design choice that suggested both culinary transparency and a commitment to cleanliness. It set the stage for high expectations.\n\nYet, upon entering, there was an inexplicable sense of unease. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint whether it stemmed from the service itself or the overall atmosphere, but the warmth and friendliness we often appreciate in a dining experience felt somewhat absent.\n\nFor our mains, we ordered The Charlie Pizza and The Jenkins Pizza. The Charlie Pizza was, unfortunately, far too salty. A touch of saltiness can enhance flavor, but in this case, it overpowered the dish and made it difficult to enjoy. The Jenkins Pizza, featuring jalape√±os for a bit of spice, was fine but lacked any particularly memorable or distinctive character.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, however, came in the form of the appetizer: Arancini. These crispy, golden risotto balls, served with a parmesan sauce and leek oil, were exceptional. The contrast of the crunchy exterior and creamy risotto center, paired with the rich and aromatic sauces, was superb ‚Äî easily redeeming the shortcomings of the pizzas we ordered.\n\nIn the end, Buzzo Wood Fired Pizza shows great potential, with a stylish setting and certain dishes that shine. A warmer, more welcoming service experience and better balance in the pizza seasoning could elevate it into a truly outstanding destination.",

The atmosphere wasn't particularly nice, but that may be because we were seated at what's probably the worst seat in the house - right next to the entry way at the bar, right next to the bathrooms, and right next to the access way to the kitchen/behind the bar.\nThe pizza was good - the crust was nice and chewy, but if you're not into white sauce or pineapple the selection becomes somewhat limited. I had the Nduja, which was good. The vegetarian person in my party had the Margherita since it's the only red sauce vegetarian pizza without pineapple - it was okay, but we've had much better elsewhere.",

I had heard a lot of great things about Buzzo's before finally getting an opportunity to eat here, so was really hopeful. Definitely see why people like it! The crust is damn near perfect, and the arancini was wonderful.\n\nThe better pizza was definitely the margherita. I had heard a lot about the potato pizza, but to me it just didn't really seem to work; there were so many ingredients and it just didn't meld well to me.\n\nNeither pizza had the marbling on the cheese I was hoping for, but definitely overall a really solid experience! Would come back for sure!",

You won't be disappointed...\n\nUpdate: Just had the Carbonara - the taste of the crust is exceptional and the topping ratio was perfect and delicious (leftovers made for an excellent breakfast topped with arugula and a poached edd üòã).  We also had the crispy cauliflower which was super yummy. Honestly- this might be the best value in Santa Cruz.",

And the food was absolutely terrific.\nWe got a celery pear fennel salad that was crisp, fresh, flavorful, and perfect. We also ordered the squash delicatta pizza, and we were impressed. The wood-fired crust had just the right amount of chew, while staying perfectly soft inside and having excellent flavor. The sauce, squash, and bacon added richness and layers of flavor and individuality. Overall, this food was made with the highest quality and most flavorful ingredients, and an attention to detail that made the entire dining experience a pleasure. I highly recommend Buzzo Pizza; you will be happy you chose to visit.",

The filling was a bit bland and the sauce wasn't anything too crazy. Just your typical arancini.\nFor this place being a pizza place, the pizza that we received was a 6/10 for me. The crust was spectacular. Very soft yet chewy, it felt like a warm mochi. The flavor was overall good but I don't like my pizza wet.\nThe waitress was very sweet and nice. It was busy for a Thursday night. She came and checked up on us three times during their rush asking how everything is.\nThe ambiance and service got me enjoying my stay here.",

Then we had the mushroom pizza and the pepperoni pizza which were ok but did not compare to the appetizers.  They only had ales and one pilsner as beer. Unfortunately no lager.  We had one ale and one pilsner which were ok but not great. Our waitress, Julia, was very friendly and did a wonderful job.  We will be back but more for the appetizers than the pizza.",

The potato pizza is an all timer.  The pepperoni is delicious and surpisingly interesting .\n\nAlso fun to sit at the high table near the oven and watch the crew toss, assemble and bake the pies.\n\nExpensive but worth it.",

I can't eat tomatoes, so it was great to see so many alternative pizza options and interesting salads on the menu. We ordered ice cold tap IPAs and the Gorgonzola pizza with cheese, dates, caramelized onion and more. Delicious! The service was attentive and friendly. It was a hot day so we sat in the spacious outdoor seating area. I was very pleased with the experience and the meal and can't wait to go back and try more from the menu!",

I'm in love with the Truffle Mushroom and the Gorgonzola, Date, Caramelized Onion pizzas (those aren't the names, but they'll know which ones you mean). Either call the order in, or stop in first before going next door to Beer Thirty. They'll text you when it's ready. You can take it home or bring it back over to BT and have another pint. :) The people that work at Buzzo are friendly and the service is fantastic (don't forget to tip them). They have a lovely patio, if you'd like to dine in and enjoy other tasty morsels off the menu. Go there! Cheers!",

We hadn't made reservations,  so sat outside under what looked like heat lamps, although they're hanging too high to provide any warmth ( we'll be eating inside next trip!)\nThe beet,avocado salad was delicious! Just the perfect flavor combination.  We also had the fried green beans which were done perfectly, the batter light and expertly fried.\nThe margherita pizza was one of the best I've had, locally for sure; great crust, just the right amount of sauce and excellent quality mozzarella.\nWe'll be making reservations and heading back soon!",

The atmosphere wasn't particularly nice, but that may be because we were seated at what's probably the worst seat in the house - right next to the entry way at the bar, right next to the bathrooms, and right next to the access way to the kitchen/behind the bar.\nThe pizza was good - the crust was nice and chewy, but if you're not into white sauce or pineapple the selection becomes somewhat limited. I had the Nduja, which was good. The vegetarian person in my party had the Margherita since it's the only red sauce vegetarian pizza without pineapple - it was okay, but we've had much better elsewhere.",
