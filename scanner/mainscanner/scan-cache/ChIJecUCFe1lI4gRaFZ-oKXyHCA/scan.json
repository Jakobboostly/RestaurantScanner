The location shares a parking lot that was difficult to park in during busy hours. Upon walking in, we had a wait while tables were cleaned. It had the sticky spilled alcohol smell throughout the restaurant that bothered me while I ate. The menu is made.of paper.and not laminated so you can see lovely food stains of the previous guests. The server was very nice but very slow and inattentive. It was not her fault as they were very busy and seemingly not appropriately staffed for the time of day. I would have ordered a second drink but waited so long for her to come back that we just got the bill. The glass my beverage had come in didn't seem completely clean. The amazing photos of food attracted us to try this spot. The food itself was overwhelmingly average. Any coney island is comparable in taste but probably cheaper and faster. The rosemary fries were good but not worth the trip alone.",

          "text": "We live right down the road and had never been before and decided to try it since one of our long time favorite bands from Detroit was playing which was Sponge. The atmosphere was pretty good considering some seating you can't see the stage, but not everyone was there for the music. We ordered the quesadilla for $14 and the Gyro for $16. It's a bit pricing since I just came back from a tourist town in Nevada and paid $3.50 for a comparable one to this which I also have posted and pictures of on my reviews here. Worth getting either way. The Gyro I wouldn't recommend. 3 medium to small sticks of meat and lettuce on it was already turning me off from it until I ate the meat and noticed it was not great and decided to just get a burger which turned out to be great. Breakfast burger had a over easy egg with 2 thick cut bacon stripes. I liked it but cannot in right mind pay $18 for it again. Most expensive burger I've had and ai think I reviewed is Prism at hollywood casino for $25, but if you have comps it is half off so $12.50 and is worth the drive alone for it. I would say if you are seeing a concert for free and no cover charge it's worth going since you will spend easy $40 and a bit more if you have drinks or app etc. I hope this helps some",

After a couple minutes we were told to sit where we wanted.\n\nThe waitress was super nice and got our drinks then came back for our dinner orders.\n\nThe chicken breast came out it was dry as shoe leather and as tough, it was hot, and no flavor.  The chili fries were good.  Not a full breast just a half of any extremely small one sliced in half.\n\nThe hamburger sliders, 3 tiny ones and a little side of homemade chips were ok but not very flavorful.\n\nThe chilied shrimp with sesame seeds were actually pretty good.\n\nThe drinks were a water and an ice tea. Both came in tiny glasses and we never got refills.  The waitress was the only one doing tables the other couple peopled stayed behind the bar.\n\nThe complaint is the price for the amount of food for two appetizers and the only entree being a smaller amount than a typical kids meal came to $65.   A total joke.\n\nThis meal should have been $30 tops.\n\nCan not recommend this place, especially with so many other restaurants so close by.",

          "text": "We live right down the road and had never been before and decided to try it since one of our long time favorite bands from Detroit was playing which was Sponge. The atmosphere was pretty good considering some seating you can't see the stage, but not everyone was there for the music. We ordered the quesadilla for $14 and the Gyro for $16. It's a bit pricing since I just came back from a tourist town in Nevada and paid $3.50 for a comparable one to this which I also have posted and pictures of on my reviews here. Worth getting either way. The Gyro I wouldn't recommend. 3 medium to small sticks of meat and lettuce on it was already turning me off from it until I ate the meat and noticed it was not great and decided to just get a burger which turned out to be great. Breakfast burger had a over easy egg with 2 thick cut bacon stripes. I liked it but cannot in right mind pay $18 for it again. Most expensive burger I've had and ai think I reviewed is Prism at hollywood casino for $25, but if you have comps it is half off so $12.50 and is worth the drive alone for it. I would say if you are seeing a concert for free and no cover charge it's worth going since you will spend easy $40 and a bit more if you have drinks or app etc. I hope this helps some",

          "text": "For 3 people to have one drink and one brunch menu item each as well as 1 appetizer, the price was just over $100. The location shares a parking lot that was difficult to park in during busy hours. Upon walking in, we had a wait while tables were cleaned. It had the sticky spilled alcohol smell throughout the restaurant that bothered me while I ate. The menu is made.of paper.and not laminated so you can see lovely food stains of the previous guests. The server was very nice but very slow and inattentive. It was not her fault as they were very busy and seemingly not appropriately staffed for the time of day. I would have ordered a second drink but waited so long for her to come back that we just got the bill. The glass my beverage had come in didn't seem completely clean. The amazing photos of food attracted us to try this spot. The food itself was overwhelmingly average. Any coney island is comparable in taste but probably cheaper and faster. The rosemary fries were good but not worth the trip alone.",

The service was pretty good except for the bartender screwing up my order, making me wait an extra 15 min for my burger. My wife was almost done with her burger before mine arrived. It would have made it worthwhile if the food had been as good as they touted it. The Brussel sprouts were mildly seasoned, but cooked well. Though cooked to perfection, my breakfast burger was quite bland (doesn't the chef believe in seasoning), and it tasted like bread and meat even though it had cheese, an egg, and some sauce.\nWe drove 45 minutes for the 4+ ratung, but I was quite unimpressed. We won't bother again unless we are already in the neighborhood.",

The atmosphere was pretty good considering some seating you can't see the stage, but not everyone was there for the music. We ordered the quesadilla for $14 and the Gyro for $16. It's a bit pricing since I just came back from a tourist town in Nevada and paid $3.50 for a comparable one to this which I also have posted and pictures of on my reviews here. Worth getting either way. The Gyro I wouldn't recommend. 3 medium to small sticks of meat and lettuce on it was already turning me off from it until I ate the meat and noticed it was not great and decided to just get a burger which turned out to be great. Breakfast burger had a over easy egg with 2 thick cut bacon stripes. I liked it but cannot in right mind pay $18 for it again. Most expensive burger I've had and ai think I reviewed is Prism at hollywood casino for $25, but if you have comps it is half off so $12.50 and is worth the drive alone for it. I would say if you are seeing a concert for free and no cover charge it's worth going since you will spend easy $40 and a bit more if you have drinks or app etc. I hope this helps some",

After a couple minutes we were told to sit where we wanted.\n\nThe waitress was super nice and got our drinks then came back for our dinner orders.\n\nThe chicken breast came out it was dry as shoe leather and as tough, it was hot, and no flavor.  The chili fries were good.  Not a full breast just a half of any extremely small one sliced in half.\n\nThe hamburger sliders, 3 tiny ones and a little side of homemade chips were ok but not very flavorful.\n\nThe chilied shrimp with sesame seeds were actually pretty good.\n\nThe drinks were a water and an ice tea. Both came in tiny glasses and we never got refills.  The waitress was the only one doing tables the other couple peopled stayed behind the bar.\n\nThe complaint is the price for the amount of food for two appetizers and the only entree being a smaller amount than a typical kids meal came to $65.   A total joke.\n\nThis meal should have been $30 tops.\n\nCan not recommend this place, especially with so many other restaurants so close by.",
