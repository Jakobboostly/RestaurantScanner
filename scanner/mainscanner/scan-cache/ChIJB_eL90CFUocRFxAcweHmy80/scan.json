The Margarita Pie was fine--I did like the crust well enough on all three--but the other two pizzas were very bland. I don't know if they're supposed to have an olive oil base or what it is, but they basically tasted solely like ingredients with melted cheese on them; virtually no flavor otherwise. So, that's not my style and I won't be purchasing from there again, especially for $28+ per pizza (more than the online menu lists); for that price, I want food that will wow me, and this wasn't it for me.",

An order can be split between 2 and even slightly more than needed if you both ordered a slice to go with it. The Sicilian, the Grandma, and the White slices were very good! The veggie is stacked. I would request less toppings too much broccoli and mushrooms. I will definitely be back, and it's a little out of my way where I live, but good enough for repeat business from me, for sure.",

          "text": "Not really sure how it should be rated... Food I'd give it 4 stars.  I've been there twice in the past week. I live nearby and saw the banner months before the actual opening of the restaurant. I kept it in mind and finally decided to try it. I called and placed an order for a large two topping pizza and they mentioned it would be 15-20 minutes which was not a problem.\n\nWe decided to try the other options on the menu last night and went in around 5:15. It started picking up shortly after we ordered. We ordered the chicken Parm with spaghetti and a hero (sandwich) with sausage and peppers, in addition to two garlic knots. I was unaware that they were sold in a set of three. After roughly 45 minutes I asked the cashier if there was any update on our food. After a few minutes she found the salad. Checked all the bags on top of the oven and in the back. At this point another individual began helping with the search. After  several minutes they found the bag with food on top of the oven, which then made me wonder how long it had been done but not called the name on the order. They then opened to check if everything was there and they forgot the garlic knots. Now remember how I ordered two, the second individual then said they were giving us six to make up for the inconvenience. Which is what I paid for to begin with.\n\nAll in all, the food was good. It was fully staffed almost to a fault because there were probably over 10 workers behind the counter and were having to constantly evade collisions. If I ever return to eat there it would have to be calling ahead for a pizza so it is ready when picking up. But $23 for a large two topping pizza is pretty pricey (additional $3 per topping) even compared to Marco's. Maybe after a few more months they will work out the kinks.",

          "text": "I've been here about 5 times now so I feel this is an accurate review:\nI see their potential so I keep coming back since I work near here. The pizza is pretty good, genuinely. The service is what needs help. The guy running this place is trying really hard you can tell, but the staff under him are so low-effort. Anytime I walk in and it's not the owner I have to get the attention of the first one to make eye contact with me, it's like they're all scared to talk to someone and make eyes at each other instead.\nLangauge barriers are a massive issue between the workers, English is 2nd and 3rd for some of them. I've witnessed that the english language is the only language a chunk of them share so communicating between one another seems impossible since it's broken and their accents are so different. I've seen several times that they use Google translate with one another.\n\nThis translates into miscommunications about food orders, and more importantly, food allergy requirements. I cannot express how that's extremely dangerous. I've witnessed first hand them mess this up with a customer and it caused that persons food to be so delayed, they had to leave because their lunch break was over.  I've seen an allergy mixup luckily be caught before the customer ate, and her extreme frustration at them about it. I hope she's left a review as well.\n\nPersonally today I'm finally writing a review because I had a \"final straw.\"\nI decided to try a salad and regret it. I asked the kid running the til how big the small vs large salads are, and he said \"BLT salad?\" And I said \"no, like size, what sizes?\" \"We do small or large.\" \"Ok but how big are they?\" \"You want small or large BLT salad?\"\nI just had to shake my head and tell him I want a small Greek salad with chicken.\nIt took them WAY too long to make it for me, and when they finally did they were asking \"to go?\" And I said \"no I can eat it here\" and they didn't understand what I said, so I said \"here. I will eat here.\" And the poor girl still wasn't understanding. So I said \"sure, to-go, that's fine.\" And she disappeared into the back and took another 4 minutes to bring me my salad all wrapped up.\nTotal was $15 and it's abysmal. It was stacked mostly with thick cut tomatoes.The chicken is good, that's fine, it tastes great, but the price is wild for what I got.\nId have gotten more for less at Harmon's salad bar just up the street.\n\nThe catalyst of my final straw isn't me though, it's the couple that came in right after me. They'd called ahead of time to ask if they do cauliflower crust, and were told yes. They ordered right after me, and I heard them order, and these guys hand the poor girl a cheese pizza with cauliflower on it. She explained to them again what she needed, and it turned into the 2 workers whispering to each other and asking her again what she needed. They pulled out their phones to Google translate and look up literal pictures for what she was talking about. They then told her they can't do that, but by now had wasted about 15 minutes of her time. They then struggled to find out how to refund her.\n\nThey need to work on communication. Desperately.",

It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs placed on a slanted stand in the box waiting for the driver to pick it up and due to it being so hot it just runs off of the pizza and you end up digging cheese and toppings out of the corner and edge of the box.\n\nMaybe research what‚Äôs going on with your deliveries $40 pizza that seems like it was carried in a backpack vertical the whole way seems like a simple remedy is in place.",

The sauce was likely from a can and just gross. Way too much cheese, but when it‚Äôs awful cheap processed cheese that is NOT a good thing. If the pizza was ever good here (and, based on past reviews, I believe it was) those days are over. Offering a BOGO deal on delivery apps won‚Äôt save this place either. Don‚Äôt fall for them trying to give a bad product away - when it‚Äôs so bad you throw the second pizza out, the savings don‚Äôt matter. I grew up back East and this is not authentic NY pizza. Pizza from the worst 24-hour slice shop in the most touristy part of the city is 100x better than the pizza sold here. I sincerely hope the owners will read this review and address the serious issues they have in the kitchen ASAP.",
