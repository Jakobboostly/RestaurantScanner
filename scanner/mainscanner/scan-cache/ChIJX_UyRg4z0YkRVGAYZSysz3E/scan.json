Unfortunately, too busy to get pictures, but we had arancini, artichoke French, penne marinara, chicken parm, fruit salad and chicken broccoli alfredo and they were all hits!!   Thank you to Kevin and all of the staff for such an easy and seamless experience to cater our party!!",

The crust was very good. The sauce had a slightly sweet taste which I loved. Toppings were plentiful. Wings were meaty and cooked perfectly.  Steak sub was delicious.  Roll super fresh. You can tell they put a lot of love into their cooking especially with seasonings. Definitely NOT your average pizza place. This will be our new favorite.  Customer service was great too.

I ended up paying $53 for the pizza‚Äôs & an order of chicken fingers and fries. The crust is nice & crispy the undercarriage is a lil limp but the red sauce makes up for it. I also got an order of chicken fingers & French fries (fries come salted, if that matters to some) that came out perfectly. The chicken fingers were perfect, crispy & paired nicely w/ the classic boss sauce. Very friendly staff just how I remembered it. Definitely will be back again to try more things on their HUGE menu they have. They also have very good daily deals, check them out if you haven‚Äôt already!",

We had two sheet pizzas, gluten free pizza, ricotta gnocchi in vodka sauce, chicken french, italian meatballs in Su day sauce, Italian sausage with peppers and onions, and salad.  Everyone raved about how delicious the food was and asked us for the name of the caterer.  The food arrived early, warm and I must agree that everything was delicious.  The staff of this family owned restaurant  was very warm, friendly and easy to work with.  It was a great experience and we will definitely use them again!

The crust was very good. The sauce had a slightly sweet taste which I loved. Toppings were plentiful. Wings were meaty and cooked perfectly.  Steak sub was delicious.  Roll super fresh. You can tell they put a lot of love into their cooking especially with seasonings. Definitely NOT your average pizza place. This will be our new favorite.  Customer service was great too.

I ended up paying $53 for the pizza‚Äôs & an order of chicken fingers and fries. The crust is nice & crispy the undercarriage is a lil limp but the red sauce makes up for it. I also got an order of chicken fingers & French fries (fries come salted, if that matters to some) that came out perfectly. The chicken fingers were perfect, crispy & paired nicely w/ the classic boss sauce. Very friendly staff just how I remembered it.

Top notch customer service from start to finish with absolutely amazing food everyone was asking who catered!  Love our standby pizza, but if you need catering, this is the place to go!  Unfortunately, too busy to get pictures, but we had arancini, artichoke French, penne marinara, chicken parm, fruit salad and chicken broccoli alfredo and they were all hits!!   Thank you to Kevin and all of the staff for such an easy and seamless experience to cater our party!!",

The crust was very good. The sauce had a slightly sweet taste which I loved. Toppings were plentiful. Wings were meaty and cooked perfectly.  Steak sub was delicious.  Roll super fresh. You can tell they put a lot of love into their cooking especially with seasonings. Definitely NOT your average pizza place. This will be our new favorite.  Customer service was great too.

I ended up paying $53 for the pizza‚Äôs & an order of chicken fingers and fries. The crust is nice & crispy the undercarriage is a lil limp but the red sauce makes up for it. I also got an order of chicken fingers & French fries (fries come salted, if that matters to some) that came out perfectly. The chicken fingers were perfect, crispy & paired nicely w/ the classic boss sauce. Very friendly staff just how I remembered it. Definitely will be back again to try more things on their HUGE menu they have. They also have very good daily deals, check them out if you haven‚Äôt already!",

We had two sheet pizzas, gluten free pizza, ricotta gnocchi in vodka sauce, chicken french, italian meatballs in Su day sauce, Italian sausage with peppers and onions, and salad.  Everyone raved about how delicious the food was and asked us for the name of the caterer.  The food arrived early, warm and I must agree that everything was delicious.  The staff of this family owned restaurant  was very warm, friendly and easy to work with.  It was a great experience and we will definitely use them again!  If you want a taste of Italy, I recommend you visit them for dinner or use them to cater your next party.  You won't be disappointed!",

Perfect Crust, delicious and flavorful sauce and great topping selections. They bake the pizzas and calzones just long enough to have a great crunch without burning.  They serve later than other pizza places so they can accommodate people who eat late. Their social media is also fun to follow.",

Staff was very kind and friendly. We sat & ate at one of the picnic tables outside next to growing vegetables pots.  Looked like most of their business is pickup or delivery but they did have tables & chairs inside to eat.  All drinks were bottles to purchase.",

We love the apps, desserts; wings, and pizza! I look forward to ordering pizza on Tuesdays! They run amazing specials. The pizza has become a staple for when our family and friends visit. Their customer service is phenomenal. We have dined in, had take away, and delivery. All forms of service have been wonderful. If we have questions about an order or event, the staff are able to answer and support us. We will continue to order from Perinton Pizza Emporium. Keep up the amazing work!",
