The food here has always been phenomenal and their wings are by far my favorite in the world, I'm not kidding I think they have the best wings on the planet. I've also met the owners on a few occasions, Tony and his wife and they were both phenomenal people and they truly have a passion for cooking and serving.  They are some of the kindest people you will ever meet.\n\nThis trip I was able to get 20 wings with four different sauces. Their signature sauce is really great, but if you want something more spicy they have options and they also have barbecue options and some others as well. The selection is fantastic.\n\nThe service here was phenomenal as well they take great care of me and the waitress was very friendly and quick to refill my water glass and serve my food. Definitely got to stop by here if you are looking for the best wings in town",

Wings took a while to come out, and when they did they were overcooked.\n\nNice and crispy, but you could taste the burnt batter a bit. The chicken was dry, you can see the flat in the photo has almost a leather like texture to the meat. A bit chewy for my liking. It was so overcooked that I was able to bite into the bone on a few occasions.\n\nI‚Äôm not kidding this was some of the worst chicken wings I‚Äôve had. Sauces were great, the truffle fries were perfectly crispy and truffle flavored. First time in my life I couldn‚Äôt get myself to finish 10 wings. Expected better, could be because it was nearing closing or because this is the second location.\n\nEither way, unremarkable for me.",

Thankfully had an opportunity while visiting upstate NY to try the wings and they were NOT wrong!! The perfect combo of crunchy on the outside, juicy chicken on the inside, along with the perfect amount of sauce on the wings. Comes with blue cheese. If you‚Äôre craving wings, go ahead and put WingNutz in the GPS and go!!",

Wings took a while to come out, and when they did they were overcooked.\n\nNice and crispy, but you could taste the burnt batter a bit. The chicken was dry, you can see the flat in the photo has almost a leather like texture to the meat. A bit chewy for my liking. It was so overcooked that I was able to bite into the bone on a few occasions.\n\nI‚Äôm not kidding this was some of the worst chicken wings I‚Äôve had. Sauces were great, the truffle fries were perfectly crispy and truffle flavored. First time in my life I couldn‚Äôt get myself to finish 10 wings. Expected better, could be because it was nearing closing or because this is the second location.\n\nEither way, unremarkable for me.",

The food here has always been phenomenal and their wings are by far my favorite in the world, I'm not kidding I think they have the best wings on the planet. I've also met the owners on a few occasions, Tony and his wife and they were both phenomenal people and they truly have a passion for cooking and serving.  They are some of the kindest people you will ever meet.\n\nThis trip I was able to get 20 wings with four different sauces. Their signature sauce is really great, but if you want something more spicy they have options and they also have barbecue options and some others as well. The selection is fantastic.\n\nThe service here was phenomenal as well they take great care of me and the waitress was very friendly and quick to refill my water glass and serve my food.

The chicken was dry, you can see the flat in the photo has almost a leather like texture to the meat. A bit chewy for my liking. It was so overcooked that I was able to bite into the bone on a few occasions.\n\nI‚Äôm not kidding this was some of the worst chicken wings I‚Äôve had. Sauces were great, the truffle fries were perfectly crispy and truffle flavored. First time in my life I couldn‚Äôt get myself to finish 10 wings. Expected better, could be because it was nearing closing or because this is the second location.\n\nEither way, unremarkable for me.",

Thankfully had an opportunity while visiting upstate NY to try the wings and they were NOT wrong!! The perfect combo of crunchy on the outside, juicy chicken on the inside, along with the perfect amount of sauce on the wings. Comes with blue cheese. If you‚Äôre craving wings, go ahead and put WingNutz in the GPS and go!!",

Lemon Pepper was a close #2, and their hot buffalo came in at the third best wing.\n\nSauces aside, simply the best flat wing I've ever tried. The crunch was unmatched.\n\nDon't sleep on Wingnutz!",

The food here has always been phenomenal and their wings are by far my favorite in the world, I'm not kidding I think they have the best wings on the planet. I've also met the owners on a few occasions, Tony and his wife and they were both phenomenal people and they truly have a passion for cooking and serving.  They are some of the kindest people you will ever meet.\n\nThis trip I was able to get 20 wings with four different sauces. Their signature sauce is really great, but if you want something more spicy they have options and they also have barbecue options and some others as well. The selection is fantastic.\n\nThe service here was phenomenal as well they take great care of me and the waitress was very friendly and quick to refill my water glass and serve my food. Definitely got to stop by here if you are looking for the best wings in town",
