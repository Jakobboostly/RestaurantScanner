Please double and triple check that your equipment isn‚Äôt contaminating other food, thank you.\nI‚Äôll say it tasted and looked good going down at least, but I can‚Äôt give anything higher than one star for obvious reasons :/ and the previous 2 times I had it deserved 5 stars",

I know with certainty it wasn‚Äôt anything else I ate. I don‚Äôt want to be mean, I understand that mistakes happen, but the only reasonable logical conclusion is that this due to some kind of cross contamination issue, given the fact you‚Äôre part of a ghost kitchen. So I felt a need to say something based on that. Please double and triple check that your equipment isn‚Äôt contaminating other food, thank you.\nI‚Äôll say it tasted and looked good going down at least, but I can‚Äôt give anything higher than one star for obvious reasons :/ and the previous 2 times I had it deserved 5 stars",
