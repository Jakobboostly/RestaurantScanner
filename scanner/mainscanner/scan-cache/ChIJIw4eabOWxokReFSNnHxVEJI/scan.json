(They were the same price).  But they are always efficient and friendly here. And the food is always fresh and good. It‚Äôs gotten more expensive lately but what hasn‚Äôt? The service here is reliable and so is the food. So if you‚Äôre gonna spend your hard earned dough getting take out or delivery, at least you know you will be happy with what you‚Äôre getting. Thanks Tony‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs keep this local gem thriving.",

Finally they figure out what food is mine only to find out they never made my fries! Waited for the fries to get done a total of 50 minutes after placing my PICK UP oder and all they offer is a soda... I had already paid for a soda!!! Never going back here again.

            "text": "I‚Äôm so silly I accidentally ordered fried calamari instead of the fried pickles I actually wanted - realized as I was checking out online, so I called them immediately, and the young men operating the front counter were so accommodating and made no big deal about it said they would just switch them out for me. (They were the same price).  But they are always efficient and friendly here. And the food is always fresh and good. It‚Äôs gotten more expensive lately but what hasn‚Äôt? The service here is reliable and so is the food. So if you‚Äôre gonna spend your hard earned dough getting take out or delivery, at least you know you will be happy with what you‚Äôre getting. Thanks Tony‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs keep this local gem thriving.",

Waited 20 minutes watching my food sit on the table while the staff mixed up my order with another patron ALSO waiting because they messed up his order. Finally they figure out what food is mine only to find out they never made my fries! Waited for the fries to get done a total of 50 minutes after placing my PICK UP oder and all they offer is a soda... I had already paid for a soda!!! Never going back here again. To any other reviewer reading this go to Nona Rosa, they have better everything.",

Oh and the salads are so great- fresh mozzarella, comes with delicious garlic knots! We also love to stop in for dough and make Stromboli at home with the kids. You really can‚Äôt go wrong there. Staff is friendly which makes it a pleasant experience.",
