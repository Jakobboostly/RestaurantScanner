Needless to say no salsa on it , the sour cream is cooked in the bottom of the layers supposedly sliced meatballs  that I saw which were thinly sliced. And was supposed to have taco seasoning in them.  I picked up to take out along w a fry . The fries were ok but $7.50 for the size was enough for my two sons. Was very disappointed w the pizza. I even said to the girl at the counter . I hope this food is very good . This is the 1st time we ordered from any PVD Pizza .I asked does it come w the sour cream on the side w salsa she stated .No . I said , oh ok.   Now after getting home seeing the pizzas but then eating it. Totally disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è.  The taco pizza has no taco seasoning whatsoever.   Smh",

We customized them to add bacon and onions, we didn‚Äôt receive that. They are also supposed to come with BBQ sauce‚Ä¶ missing. Spent a good amount of money here to be thrown away.

On Friday night, I ordered nachos and a make your own calzone with spinach, mushrooms, and blue cheese. When I picked it up,  I put it in the fridge for dinner  Saturday night. When I got home Saturday, it was very late ( after they were closed). I noticed that it tasted strange. It was chicken parm which I had not ordered. I called Sunday to let them know that I received the wrong order. I even had most of it left and offered to bring it in to show that I had received the wrong order The manager stated that the owner refused to do anything because it had been too long. I was not looking for free food. I just wanted the calzone for which I paid. The owner still refused to do anything. I will never order from there again That is a shame since the food is good., and the waitstaff are very nice.  They have lost  a frequent customer over one calzone!!!!  I even had an account with them where I earned points with orders. I have never before complained, but this was the wrong order. I would advise that if you order from here, to check your order immediately to make sure it is right because otherwise they will not help you.",

          "text": "I live very close to PVD Pizza West Warwick. The food is good. However, I had a very bad experience with service. On Friday night, I ordered nachos and a make your own calzone with spinach, mushrooms, and blue cheese. When I picked it up,  I put it in the fridge for dinner  Saturday night. When I got home Saturday, it was very late ( after they were closed). I noticed that it tasted strange. It was chicken parm which I had not ordered. I called Sunday to let them know that I received the wrong order. I even had most of it left and offered to bring it in to show that I had received the wrong order The manager stated that the owner refused to do anything because it had been too long. I was not looking for free food. I just wanted the calzone for which I paid. The owner still refused to do anything. I will never order from there again That is a shame since the food is good., and the waitstaff are very nice.  They have lost  a frequent customer over one calzone!!!!  I even had an account with them where I earned points with orders. I have never before complained, but this was the wrong order. I would advise that if you order from here, to check your order immediately to make sure it is right because otherwise they will not help you.",

Needless to say no salsa on it , the sour cream is cooked in the bottom of the layers supposedly sliced meatballs  that I saw which were thinly sliced. And was supposed to have taco seasoning in them.  I picked up to take out along w a fry . The fries were ok but $7.50 for the size was enough for my two sons. Was very disappointed w the pizza. I even said to the girl at the counter . I hope this food is very good . This is the 1st time we ordered from any PVD Pizza .I asked does it come w the sour cream on the side w salsa she stated .No . I said , oh ok.   Now after getting home seeing the pizzas but then eating it. Totally disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è.  The taco pizza has no taco seasoning whatsoever.   Smh",

          "text": "I got very sick from eating here. I'm not sure what the conditions are in this establishment, but I've contracted food poisoning from eating their food.\n\nI made a doordash order for pizza and a burger two days ago. The food arrived, and the pizza was blah, and the burger was PINK. I made sure to request \"well done\" for the burger patty which was an option on the doordash website, and the patty hardly came close to medium rare. So it's safe to say they blatantly ignored my selection.\n\nThen I made a mistake. I ate it anyway. As I write this I am still dealing with sulfur burps, extremely painful stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Not to mention me vomiting earlier. Not sure if it's e.coli or what, but this is the kind of thing that will make me never return. No food is worth suffering for. Especially food that doesn't taste that good. The pizza was mediocre, as was the burger. The only great thing was the food arriving hot. If you have low immunity or a sensitive stomach, I'm going to have to warn you to skip this place. Or if you persist on ordering here, don't get meat.",

My sandwich was a sloppy as It ever could be the tomatoes were squishy and it did not taste at all like a chicken Caprice I'm pretty sure it had some sort of blue cheese on it it was disgusting. The pretzel bites were over fried and the beer cheese was cold. Needless to say I am never going back to this establishment ever again I was very unsatisfied with my lunch and wasted money..",

          "text": "I love their food. Everything I've ever ordered has been awesome, and their delivery is quick! However, they've been stingy with some of their items lately. I understand prices going up because prices are going up everywhere, but I don't understand also serving puny portions at that increased price. My husband ordered Buffalo Chicken Wings at $9.99, and his order is on the left. I ordered the BBQ faux chicken wings with fries. They cost $13.99, did not come with any BBQ sauce and are the order on right. It almost looks like a children's meal. A few months back, I ordered the corkscrew shrimp. The price had just increased from $7.99 to $9.99. I'm okay with that because I'm still going to get a small restaurant container full, right? No. Actually, I received 7 (seven) shrimp spirals. I thought some had fallen out of the container or maybe the driver got hungry or something else unexpected had happened to cause these tiny shrimp pieces to cost $1.25 each. No. The person I spoke with on the phone told me that they were decreasing their portions (while increasing the price) due to the ecomony. So, I haven't purchased the shrimp since. I would've thought that would put an end to the inconsistencies in portions to price. Until today. We've been frequent customers of theirs since they first opened their doors in West Warwick, but I'm probably going to start looking for other establishments for take out/delivery. We'll probably still order pizza from there, but only pizza, because at least you know what you're getting with a pizza.",
