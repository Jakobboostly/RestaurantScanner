We ordered a half and half pizza and an order of fries, the waitress made sure the fries were at a good temp when they came out so our hangry toddler could dive right in! The pizza came out in a timely manner, our toddler is VERY picky about his cheese pizza and ate 2 whole slices. We will definitely be back!!",

The server was nice but they were definitely understaffed and the kitchen was backed up. The food was relatively warm. The pizza was good. I still can't believe they put a tomato on a hamburger like that. I always tip well regardless of the service. Very disappointed. Maybe being Sunday they were slammed. Cannot recommend.",

We ordered a half and half pizza and an order of fries, the waitress made sure the fries were at a good temp when they came out so our hangry toddler could dive right in! The pizza came out in a timely manner, our toddler is VERY picky about his cheese pizza and ate 2 whole slices. We will definitely be back!!",
