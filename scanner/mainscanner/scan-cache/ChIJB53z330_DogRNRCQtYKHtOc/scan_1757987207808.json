          "text": "My wife and I come up to visit her family frequently and we order from Papa Joe's at least once per visit.  Normally we have a very positive experience, however the last two times we ordered it has been the opposite.  We ordered 2 large pizzas and two orders of baked mostaccioli for a family gathering.  Both of the pizza's had their toppings slide off (I only took a picture of the worst one), neither of the baked mostacciolis had the top layer if cheese and one had very little sauce.  In the previous order we had the same issue with the mostaccioli (no cheese on top) and one of our pizzas was undercooked and not sliced while the other was overcooked.  Both of these orders were placed on a Saturday evening so I am assuming that there was a lot of activity during that time so I could understand this happening once and would probably not thought anything of it but twice in a row is the start of a problem.  If volumes are that high have the person taking orders let people know that due to high volumes there may be an extended wait or that some items may not be available for delivery.  This would be much more acceptable than paying for food that is incorrectly prepared or damaged in transit.  The quality of the food is why we are ordering from Papa Joe's and not Papa John's.\n\n*Update - we have had no further issues like the ones mentioned above.",

Now, I would rather be strapped into a chair waiting for the nitrogen and my death than step into Papa Joe's. My wife wanted to eat there, so I ordered the cheapest thing, a regular hamburger. Can you believe their chef cannot make a hamburger! Had I known this I would brought in a Happy Meal, because they don't have a sign posted to prevent it I should have. For $10 I got a burger burned on the outside and sealing all the grease inside. One slice of tomatoe, a little lettuce, and no onion. TALK ABOUT CHEAP! There's one waitress on the floor, lots of old women coming in while our food is getting cold. Now my hamburger was going from bad to horrible. Olmpic Star can do a hamburger 100% better. McDonald's aces it. Italian? My wife had the stuffed shells. Cost of ingredients about $4, labor minimal (pretend chef), delivery (I expected Jesus to show up any minute). She sent her order back for the microwave. They changed the cost of meat add-ons for the pasta. Could it be the Italian sausage was exposed to the bird flu causing some unknown shortage? I was so disgusted I did not take any photos. I'll never go back. Damn them anyway. I should have walked out when I sensed I should. Please stay away from this place, because you matter.",

Flavorful. And great. We had Adam as our server. Very attentive to us. Offered my pasta substitution because I wasn't a fan of the original option. But my favorite part had to be the homemade cooked bread. I ate it before I took a picture. But it had to be some of the best tasting bread I have ever eaten at a restaurant. Thank you Adam.",
