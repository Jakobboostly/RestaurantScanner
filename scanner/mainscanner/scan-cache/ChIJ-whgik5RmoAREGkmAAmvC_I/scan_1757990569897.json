The salads were fresh and lovely. Their honey mustard vinaigrette was perfect. I highly recommend for a relaxed and special dining experience.",

Even though the place was completely empty they tried sitting us in the bar area. We asked for a booth in the back where it's decorated, the hostess said no they are only for larger parties. We were sat at a small table and in our time there only one booth was used. The menu didn't have traditional Irish bar food and no sandwiches or fish and chips. The waitress steered us wrong with the salad size ( mini was not filling enough) and a salad from Panera or Jack's Urban Eats would have been a better size and higher quality. My husband's food was also terrible. He could finish it. It was a waste of money and time. I would not return and not recommend to others.",

From the moment we walked in, the ambiance transported us to a whimsical fairytale world, charming, cozy, and full of creative details that make the whole experience feel truly enchanted.\n\nBut the real magic happened when our dessert arrived. Not only was it delicious, but it was decorated with such thoughtful artistry that we had to pause just to admire it! Huge shoutout to Kailyn, the talented soul behind our dessert's beautiful presentation. Her creativity and attention to detail turned a sweet treat into a moment of wonder. You can tell she pours love into her work!! thank you, Kailyn, for adding that extra sparkle to our evening!\n\nHighly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy great food, imaginative ambiance, and a touch of fairy dust.

The whiskey shrimp was a hit with 4 of us, one of us said the pasty was great and the two of us who had crepes were very pleased. My friend loved the lobster bisque too. The salads were fresh and lovely. Their honey mustard vinaigrette was perfect. I highly recommend for a relaxed and special dining experience.",

I ordered an adult beverage and my friend ordered a soda.. how long would you expect to get a drink from this place?! It took way over 30 min to get both of our drinks. I have been in the serving industry for years and this service was repulsive! We ordered the food and it took way over a half hour to even get our food that we ordered. I had to ask our server if we could get an eta on when we were going to get our food. Everyone around us was getting served but us. This was a huge bummer because I used to hear such good things about this place. I had ordered the fillet mignon ordered it med well.. I got it well done‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs fine but really you guys don‚Äôt even know how to input orders correctly but the final product isn‚Äôt what you ordered! I was way to hungry to send it back because I was afraid that it would take another hour for me to get my food back. Our server seemed over worked and so over being at this place. I came all the way from San Francisco to dine at this place. Our bill wasn‚Äôt to bad but still service was horrible. If you want food here I dont recommend. If you just want drinks I highly recommend but don‚Äôt expect good service. I will not be back! People don‚Äôt waste your time at this place!",

          "text": "I had a 7:30 reservation and arrived at 7:00. I let the hostess know we were early and still waiting for the rest of our party. She said our table would be ready and told us to check back in a bit. We returned around 7:15, and that‚Äôs when things started to fall apart.\n\nShe told us our table still wasn‚Äôt ready but suggested we take a seat at the bar in the meantime. I looked around and noticed at least four or five empty tables. When I asked why we couldn‚Äôt be seated at one of them, she explained that we had a specific table assigned. That already felt odd, but it got worse. A few minutes later, she returned and said the party at \"our table\" had just ordered their food and it could be another 20 to 40 minutes before we could sit. At this point, it was already 7:20, just ten minutes before our actual reservation time.\n\nShe told us again we were welcome to eat at the bar. I politely pointed to the open table directly across from us and asked why we couldn‚Äôt just sit there. She said someone had reserved that one for 7:45. I asked why we couldn‚Äôt swap, let that guest have our table when it opened, and seat us at the available one. Her answer was simple: they don‚Äôt do that. We were told our options were to either eat at the bar or leave. So we left.\n\nIn all my years of dining out, I have never had a restaurant turn away a party with a valid reservation when there were open tables clearly available. This was the most rigid and customer-unfriendly seating policy I‚Äôve ever experienced. No flexibility. No effort to find a solution. Just a take-it-or-leave-it attitude.\n\nI had high hopes for the ambiance, but honestly, it looked more like a makeshift wine bar with fake vines on the ceiling than anything close to an enchanted forest. It felt cramped, not magical. The menu looked fine, but I wasn‚Äôt about to spend $60 to eat short ribs at a bar after being treated like an inconvenience.\n\nWe didn‚Äôt stay, and I won‚Äôt be going back. If you're expecting a unique experience or thoughtful hospitality, I would look elsewhere. This was all style, no substance, and a complete failure in customer service.",

From the moment we walked in, the ambiance transported us to a whimsical fairytale world, charming, cozy, and full of creative details that make the whole experience feel truly enchanted.\n\nBut the real magic happened when our dessert arrived. Not only was it delicious, but it was decorated with such thoughtful artistry that we had to pause just to admire it! Huge shoutout to Kailyn, the talented soul behind our dessert's beautiful presentation. Her creativity and attention to detail turned a sweet treat into a moment of wonder. You can tell she pours love into her work!! thank you, Kailyn, for adding that extra sparkle to our evening!\n\nHighly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy great food, imaginative ambiance, and a touch of fairy dust. We‚Äôll definitely be back!",

          "text": "My family and I went here for my birthday. We were a party of twelve and we all fit comfortably into their larger booth and they accommodated my father who was in a wheelchair. I had really high hopes for the evening but in the end was pretty let down to be honest.\n\nThe positives: I spoke to the owner to make the reservation and she was very kind and also very accommodating to my four year old nephew who has autism and refuses to eat the majority of foods so she allowed us to bring in his food so he could enjoy the time with us. The environment was fun although it was so dark at our table we were reading the menu with our phones. The waitress did bring us out a little table lamp that made a huge difference. The service was well. Our server was working her butt off and when I spoke to the manager about all of the issues that kept happening she handled it well and all of our interactions with the staff were lovely and cordial and the manager did her best to make it right. The food was really good and once all the dust was settled we really did enjoy our meal. It took a long time for the different phases of our meal to come out and the problem solving to happen so by the time it was time for dessert the kitchen had closed, but they kindly got together all of our chocolate fondue stuff after closing and I appreciate it.\n\nNow unfortunately for the negatives.\nThere was old food under the fondue burners when we sat down. One bummer was that at such a long and large table, they only had one spot to put the fondue pots so everyone had to stretch across the table to try and eat it and we were dripping hot cheese everywhere. They must have plated the sides of everyone‚Äôs food before the main entree because everyone‚Äôs potatoes were cold by the time the entrees arrived and some entrees were cold too. My husbands and mothers filet mignon was very well done when both asked for medium rare and It was hard to get the attention of our server(not out of neglect, she was just very busy). We had limited table space and dishes kept piling up and I had to keep stopping people to ask to take them and I felt really cramped the whole time. Between the waiting times and the waiting to fix things times it just took forever and none of us were really in the mood to finish our meal at that point so we boxed it up.\n\nIt honestly felt like one thing after the other going wrong and it was kind of a bummer because we spent almost $1000 and I truly don‚Äôt believe the experience was worth that.\n\nI just think the restaurant wasn‚Äôt equipped to handle such a large party. I think if it were just two or four of us it would have been a lot smoother but it was kind of turning into a sh*tshow and it was a real bummer because I had been really looking forward to my birthday dinner for a while.  The waitress and the manager worked really hard to salvage the night so I will say the staff and food was fabulous, I just think our party was too large for them to handle. I would like to come back with just my husband and try a more simple experience to see how it goes.",

We were sat at a small table and in our time there only one booth was used. The menu didn't have traditional Irish bar food and no sandwiches or fish and chips. The waitress steered us wrong with the salad size ( mini was not filling enough) and a salad from Panera or Jack's Urban Eats would have been a better size and higher quality.

They donhave a shop next door that sells their pasties without the dining experience and it's about half the price ($15 vs. $29), would recommend if you don't care about the dine-in experience but want the food.\n\nI got the Irish pasty, and it was good but considering the amount of money I spent on it, not worth it. It wasn't very big, finished it in one sitting and could have eaten another. It did fill me up, though.\n\nGot a flight of mead, none of which stood out, but I rarely drink mead so I'm not sure what defines a good/bad mead and can't speak objectively about it.\n\nNice atmosphere, had live music, which was fun. I'm not the target audience, I'm not into ren fairs or Tolkien or anything, and I don't really like medieval food (or the smells. Walking in made me a little worried at first lol), so take all this with a grain of salt. If you're into those kinds of things, I do think you'll like this place.\n\nOverall, the three of us split the cost of a flight of mead, three main dishes, and a chocolate fondue. We each paid a little under $90 each (including tip), so go in expecting to drop 100 on your meal.",

Our server today was Kari and she was awesome, definitely going the extra mile to ensure we had a phenomenal dining experience.\nThe food is out of this world. The Kilt Lifter is my all time favorite closely followed by the filet mignon and lobster. The blackberry key lime pie is over the top. However I promise you will not be disappointed with anything you order.\nThe atmosphere is whimsical and fun, while also feeling intimate. When you arrive you are given lighted headbands that are yours to keep. The music is uplifting and definitely helps to set the mood. I will keep coming back again and again.

We've lived here for 2 years, having seen how intriguing it looked many times, and even saw it won that TV show 'Best Bite in Town' competition. So we were really looking forward to trying this place out on Valentines Day.\n\nUnfortunately, our experience was nothing short of terrible. We had a reservaion set for 3:30pm, but we didn't even get to sit down until 4:30, and it took a solid half hour after that for someone to take our order - and this was only accomplished because my husband had to get up and find someone. Considering how there are so few tables, and we counted four waitresses to take care of them, I can't see any circumstance where 'losing' a table is acceptable. Bottom line, we were there for almost three hours, when it should have been half that.\n\nThe food was alright. We thought the soup was really good, but the entree and dessert were underwhelming. For what it cost, we were not impressed with it.\n\nThe only saving grace for the place was its ambience. The decorations were beautiful, and the live music performers were excellent.\n\nOverall, we honestly felt like our Valentines Day was ruined. It was a terrible experience. After all that, we were only offered a 5% Discount, which we felt was far too insufficient. We will not be returning.",

The live Celtic music and TV screens portraying castles further contribute to the already magical atmosphere. Plan on spending some time here as they don't rush the tables for turnover. I would suggest parties no larger than eight due to the size of their largest booth (hence my only complaint: accommodating reservations for party of 10 seated at a table clearly meant for eight people).",

I don't quite remember the name of what I ordered, but I've never found a better beef. You guys are an astounding place, and I can't wait for my next visit",

          "text": "Our first impression of the restaurant was that it was really cute, nicely decorated, pretty dim, and the hostess was really welcoming and sweet. We were a party of 8 and the booth they reserved for us was tiny so they had to add an extra table to the end of it. How they thought we would all fit in that little booth is beyond me, but they made it work.\n\nThe food choices were okay, we were all able to find something we liked except for the kids. The kid's menu is very limited and costs about as much as ordering from the regular menu.\n\nWe were greeted by our waitress (I don't remember her name) and she seemed nice enough. She took our drink orders and came back around promptly to take our food orders. The drink menu is a little limited but standard. My husband wanted a second beer and when he asked for one the waitress proceeded to flirt with him in front of all of us which was funny. It was such an obvious gesture that my youngest who is 11 even looked at me and said \"what was that all about?\" after she left. We laughed about it and moved on, even if that wouldn't be the last time she did it during our time there.\n\nThe food came out and that's when things took a turn. The kid's menu chicken on a stick was so bad and dry that one of the kids would not take another bite. Typically our kids will eat what's on their plate but that was not the case here. My other kid had a crepe with chicken in it but the chicken tasted like fish (our 11 year old had the same dish and he would not take another bite as well). I thought the kids might be overreacting, so I took a bite and it was inedible. It really did taste like fish. My salad was a mediocre goat cheese salad, how you can mess that up is beyond me, but I ate it. My husband had the KING STEAK, it was more like a king medallion and we laughed at him for a solid 10 minutes about it because it was just that disappointing. The mashed potatoes it came with were sour and the portions were interesting.  The steak was so dry! My sister and her husband had a pasty pie each and they took one bite and couldn't continue because it was inedible to them (again, we are people who typically eat whatever is on our plate even if it's disappointing). We noticed that a few tables near us were also complaining about their food and we realized it seemed to be a trend there, which was interesting because I had looked at the reviews beforehand and they all seemed like good reviews.\n\nAnyway, we are not really ones to complain so we didn't say much during the meal. We ended up just asking the waitress to take our plates which were full of food, no one really ate. That's when her attitude towards us began to shift. She took some plates and came back and asked if we wanted boxes. When we politely said no, she became snarky and said \"well give me those plates then\" and proceeded to have us bus the table for her which was appalling but also a little funny. She was even a little rude to the teens at the end of the table when she took their plates. We couldn't believe what was happening. No offer to fix the situation, no question about the quality of the meal, nothing. I can imagine that since this is a family owned business, she took it personally that we didn't eat. However, she made no attempt at fixing the situation. We asked for the bill and she was gone for a while before she brought the bill to us. After we paid, we never saw her again. Not a departing \"have a good evening\", nothing, Just petty behavior. I feel sad that this is our experience as we were so excited to go there for my teen's birthday (when she brought dessert during our meal her happy birthday song was also petty as her attitude was so bad during lol!). We love supporting small businesses but not when our bill is $400, we didn't eat, gratuity is built in, and the service was not only subpar, but straight up rude. Walking to the restroom I peaked into the kitchen and that was a disgusting disaster too.\n\nAnyway we had to go to McDonald's after because the kids were starving.",

          "text": "Dine in w/reservations. I was really excited about this, I had saved it on my TV from Best Bites and they were the winner from Placerville. OK going in took a couple of min for anyone to notice us. I told them my name and i had a 2:15 reservation. We were seated at a high cocktail table 4 to 5 feet in the door across from the bar. Enough room so a person can walk between us and the barstools. When the menu's were brought I ask if this was seating for dinner and was told yes. I ask if they had a regular table and was told they were for reservations so I told them for the 2nd time I had a reservation. We were then seated at a small table for 2 which was fine. It was so dark I could not tell how many tables their were but I would think not more than 4 to 5. I had to use my phone for light to read the menu ( which tells me I am barely going to be able to see the food when it comes. I ordered the guineas glazed salmon with roasted veggies and Swiss cheese mashed potatoes. The salmon was very good although it was sitting on top of the mashed potatoes something I am not a fan off. The mashed potatoes were on the thin side, 2 roasted carrots that were almost overcooked and the small serving of brocolini was overcooked to the point of being rubbery, priced at $43.00. My husband order an 8 Oz filet mignon with a 5 Oz lobster tail priced at $81.00. They had a 10 to 12 Oz filet with 2 lobster tails for $111.00. Veggies and potatoes were the same as mine. His filet looked to be on the large side but we didn't think anything of it at the time and it was really hard to see the food. He had 1 lobster tail so it seemed to be what he ordered. The filet was not tender and had sinue running through it making it difficult to cut.  Not a typical filet at all which at med rare should have been very tender.  When we received the bill we had been charged $111.00 for the larger filet that comes with 2 lobster tails. I told the waitress he ordered the 8 Oz with 1 lobster tail and they very kindly corrected the bill. My husband didn't eat all of the filet and brought it home to make a sandwich. When we got home I weighed the leftover and it was 8 Oz. So he did get a larger filet if it was a filet ( we are not sure because of the sinue and being tough) than he ordered but 1 lobster tail which is as it was supposed to be. Overall we were not pleased with the food or the restaurant. It was OK for a bar. The service was good and we tipped because of that but we won't be going back.",

The fondue comes with pre cooked chicken and meatballs, the shrimp were ok and the beef was not good- there were a few pieces of meat had silver skin (tendon) on them. Very small portion for the price. The vegetables included was a serving too small for a child much 2 adults. The celery was not good pieces- the inner white piece. My crepe, I think it was truffle mushroom Swiss- not very much inside- the chicken caprese was ok. I guess we paid $158 for the ambiance and the lighted headsets because the food was not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else. We are not full and will eat when we get home.",

            "text": "My family and I went here for my birthday. We were a party of twelve and we all fit comfortably into their larger booth and they accommodated my father who was in a wheelchair. I had really high hopes for the evening but in the end was pretty let down to be honest.\n\nThe positives: I spoke to the owner to make the reservation and she was very kind and also very accommodating to my four year old nephew who has autism and refuses to eat the majority of foods so she allowed us to bring in his food so he could enjoy the time with us. The environment was fun although it was so dark at our table we were reading the menu with our phones. The waitress did bring us out a little table lamp that made a huge difference. The service was well. Our server was working her butt off and when I spoke to the manager about all of the issues that kept happening she handled it well and all of our interactions with the staff were lovely and cordial and the manager did her best to make it right. The food was really good and once all the dust was settled we really did enjoy our meal. It took a long time for the different phases of our meal to come out and the problem solving to happen so by the time it was time for dessert the kitchen had closed, but they kindly got together all of our chocolate fondue stuff after closing and I appreciate it.\n\nNow unfortunately for the negatives.\nThere was old food under the fondue burners when we sat down. One bummer was that at such a long and large table, they only had one spot to put the fondue pots so everyone had to stretch across the table to try and eat it and we were dripping hot cheese everywhere. They must have plated the sides of everyone‚Äôs food before the main entree because everyone‚Äôs potatoes were cold by the time the entrees arrived and some entrees were cold too. My husbands and mothers filet mignon was very well done when both asked for medium rare and It was hard to get the attention of our server(not out of neglect, she was just very busy). We had limited table space and dishes kept piling up and I had to keep stopping people to ask to take them and I felt really cramped the whole time. Between the waiting times and the waiting to fix things times it just took forever and none of us were really in the mood to finish our meal at that point so we boxed it up.\n\nIt honestly felt like one thing after the other going wrong and it was kind of a bummer because we spent almost $1000 and I truly don‚Äôt believe the experience was worth that.\n\nI just think the restaurant wasn‚Äôt equipped to handle such a large party. I think if it were just two or four of us it would have been a lot smoother but it was kind of turning into a sh*tshow and it was a real bummer because I had been really looking forward to my birthday dinner for a while.  The waitress and the manager worked really hard to salvage the night so I will say the staff and food was fabulous, I just think our party was too large for them to handle. I would like to come back with just my husband and try a more simple experience to see how it goes.",

I ordered an adult beverage and my friend ordered a soda.. how long would you expect to get a drink from this place?! It took way over 30 min to get both of our drinks. I have been in the serving industry for years and this service was repulsive! We ordered the food and it took way over a half hour to even get our food that we ordered. I had to ask our server if we could get an eta on when we were going to get our food. Everyone around us was getting served but us. This was a huge bummer because I used to hear such good things about this place. I had ordered the fillet mignon ordered it med well.. I got it well done‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs fine but really you guys don‚Äôt even know how to input orders correctly but the final product isn‚Äôt what you ordered! I was way to hungry to send it back because I was afraid that it would take another hour for me to get my food back. Our server seemed over worked and so over being at this place. I came all the way from San Francisco to dine at this place. Our bill wasn‚Äôt to bad but still service was horrible. If you want food here I dont recommend. If you just want drinks I highly recommend but don‚Äôt expect good service. I will not be back! People don‚Äôt waste your time at this place!",
