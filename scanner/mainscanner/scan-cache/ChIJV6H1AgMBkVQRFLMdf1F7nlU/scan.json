          "text": "I had heard some good things about Secret Burger Kitchen so I set out to see for myself. The location is within the Holiday Inn Hotel off of 84th on Hosmer. Not the most upscale of areas so it really surprised me how much this dining experience cost me.\nThe staff was great. A young lady showed me the kiosk that you can order and pay through. The order (a signature 1/3 lb cheese burger with bacon and a chop Philly cheese. Both came with fries) came quickly and was nicely packaged for takeout. It was still plenty hot eating it at home.\nThe quality and taste was a solid 8 out of 10 so I was happy that what I had heard about the place was accurate.\nUnfortunately I won't be going back. The meal we had (which I will simply cook at home next time) rang up after a 15% tip to nearly $45. Come on, guys. I mean, $25 would have kept me coming back from time to time to try other menu items. But nope.\nThe place was clean and the food is good. Price? smh",

The fry sauce was good it had a little bit of spice which I did like. The service was good the staff were nice  and welcoming. There was plenty of parking and the inside was nice and clean and they also have a few tables outside. Over all the food was good but I think it was pricey. $17 for double burger and fries without a dink.",

          "text": "I had heard some good things about Secret Burger Kitchen so I set out to see for myself. The location is within the Holiday Inn Hotel off of 84th on Hosmer. Not the most upscale of areas so it really surprised me how much this dining experience cost me.\nThe staff was great. A young lady showed me the kiosk that you can order and pay through. The order (a signature 1/3 lb cheese burger with bacon and a chop Philly cheese. Both came with fries) came quickly and was nicely packaged for takeout. It was still plenty hot eating it at home.\nThe quality and taste was a solid 8 out of 10 so I was happy that what I had heard about the place was accurate.\nUnfortunately I won't be going back. The meal we had (which I will simply cook at home next time) rang up after a 15% tip to nearly $45. Come on, guys. I mean, $25 would have kept me coming back from time to time to try other menu items. But nope.\nThe place was clean and the food is good. Price? smh",

          "text": "First of all, no one eats as many burgers as I do! I absolutely love hamburgers! I‚Äôve ate burgers all over the country and outside the US. This double smash burger with cheese with the SBK sauce and jalape√±os/Serrano peppers was the best burger I‚Äôve had hands down! I did go in on a Friday night at about 10:30pm and was the only customers eating at this time. The burger was perfect! The beef pattie‚Äôs were so hot temp wise it almost burned my tongue! The beef was cooked perfect and very flavorful. You could tell it was top quality beef. I see some reviews saying they waited forever for a cold burned burger, well I suggest go in on off times when it‚Äôs slow and you won‚Äôt be disappointed! Can‚Äôt wait to get back for another round! It‚Äôs definitely made my list as the number one best burger in Tacoma with Beach Tavern coming in second now, which used to be the best burger in Tacoma. Sorry Beach, this place took your top spot on my list. Again I think I eat more burgers then anyone lol",

Had to go up at one point and inquire about an eta. Fries were amazing no complaints there. The burger (I had a double bacon cheeseburger) was good for the most part, perfectly smashed. My only gripe is that it was overly salty. The chef had a heavy salt hand that day. Probably won't go out of my way to go there again. The place is a little on the pricey side as well. If I happen to be in the area I would give it another shot.",

          "text": "After all the rave reviews, we were looking forward to trying what many people said was \"the best hamburger ever\".\nThe place  was crowded when we got there and there were many \"to go\" orders. We were fine with a wait as we expected the burgers to be something worth waiting for. The servers were pleasant enough (although they looked a little understaffed). After a good 45 minute wait, our burgers came out and looked absolutely nothing like the pictures. Mine was burned to a crisp. Totally dry and overcooked. The was minimal sauce and a very small segment of a piece of lettuce. Again, nothing like the pictures. All I could taste was the totally charred, dry meat and salt. Such a disappointment  after all this hype and a very expensive burger that was totally overpriced for what was presented. I'm guessing a person's impression would vary based on who is in the kitchen cooking the food. We obviously had someone working who was more concerned in just getting food out, regardless if it caught on fire and burned, than caring about the quality. We do not plan to return.",

Over cooked, dry. I gave the food rating a 2 because the fries were pretty good.  We waited 45 minutes for a hamburger!\nService was okay though sparse, meaning they seemed very inexperienced and understaffed.  I asked for water 3 times and never got it until I was leaving and was handed a bottle of water.\nAmbience nonexistent.  It is in a Holiday Inn in a very sketchy part of Tacoma and the to go clientele which made up the majority of the customers reflected this.  I would never suggest anyone to go there unless they were staying at the hotel and had no other choice.",

My only gripe is that it was overly salty. The chef had a heavy salt hand that day. Probably won't go out of my way to go there again. The place is a little on the pricey side as well.

We were fine with a wait as we expected the burgers to be something worth waiting for. The servers were pleasant enough (although they looked a little understaffed). After a good 45 minute wait, our burgers came out and looked absolutely nothing like the pictures. Mine was burned to a crisp. Totally dry and overcooked. The was minimal sauce and a very small segment of a piece of lettuce. Again, nothing like the pictures. All I could taste was the totally charred, dry meat and salt. Such a disappointment  after all this hype and a very expensive burger that was totally overpriced for what was presented. I'm guessing a person's impression would vary based on who is in the kitchen cooking the food. We obviously had someone working who was more concerned in just getting food out, regardless if it caught on fire and burned, than caring about the quality. We do not plan to return.",
