Brick oven, fresh ingredients, great flavor, delicious! Now, the beer; great selection. Get a flight, try a selection.  My favorite? The Box Turtle Box. There's a reason its award winning!

          "text": "Such a fun place! Great atmosphere, creative use of space. We first went for coffee, which was great and included plant-based milk options. Nice sitting area at the window, with couches overlooking the beautiful county courthouse. Lots of indoor seating with a good selection of games and coffee table books.  While there we noticed they have a micro-brewery, pizza place and food truck park in the daytime & evening hours, with outdoor seating in a side courtyard. The next day we went back and had pizza and beer. Nice gourmet pizza options. Our party got two: a typical meat option and another with fig,  Gruy√®re and spinach; both were excellent with good, thin crust. The beer was good; I also got a fun holiday special champagne drink with frozen cranberries and rosemary. We went on a Saturday night and there was a very talented young woman singing, accompanied by a guitarist. It provided a nice ambiance and was not so loud that you couldn‚Äôt talk with your friends. Excellent place to go, morning or night, for good coffee, food and beer. Highly recommend!",

Whether you just need a break from sitting to grab a beer and stretch, or you‚Äôre craving some pizza, this place will not disappoint! We stopped in on our trip to Angel Fire for a beer and some pizza. Pizza next door is Ninja turtle themed names. The RAF was amazing! I tried several beers but the Hannah was definitely my favorite! Nice break from a long drive. We will be adding this to our must stop places on our way to and from NM and CO!",

Nice sitting area at the window, with couches overlooking the beautiful county courthouse. Lots of indoor seating with a good selection of games and coffee table books.  While there we noticed they have a micro-brewery, pizza place and food truck park in the daytime & evening hours, with outdoor seating in a side courtyard. The next day we went back and had pizza and beer. Nice gourmet pizza options. Our party got two: a typical meat option and another with fig,  Gruy√®re and spinach; both were excellent with good, thin crust. The beer was good; I also got a fun holiday special champagne drink with frozen cranberries and rosemary. We went on a Saturday night and there was a very talented young woman singing, accompanied by a guitarist. It provided a nice ambiance and was not so loud that you couldn‚Äôt talk with your friends. Excellent place to go, morning or night, for good coffee, food and beer. Highly recommend!",

Brick oven, fresh ingredients, great flavor, delicious! Now, the beer; great selection. Get a flight, try a selection.  My favorite? The Box Turtle Box. There's a reason its award winning! We will be back!",

Whether you just need a break from sitting to grab a beer and stretch, or you‚Äôre craving some pizza, this place will not disappoint! We stopped in on our trip to Angel Fire for a beer and some pizza. Pizza next door is Ninja turtle themed names. The RAF was amazing! I tried several beers but the Hannah was definitely my favorite! Nice break from a long drive. We will be adding this to our must stop places on our way to and from NM and CO!",

            "text": "Such a fun place! Great atmosphere, creative use of space. We first went for coffee, which was great and included plant-based milk options. Nice sitting area at the window, with couches overlooking the beautiful county courthouse. Lots of indoor seating with a good selection of games and coffee table books.  While there we noticed they have a micro-brewery, pizza place and food truck park in the daytime & evening hours, with outdoor seating in a side courtyard. The next day we went back and had pizza and beer. Nice gourmet pizza options. Our party got two: a typical meat option and another with fig,  Gruy√®re and spinach; both were excellent with good, thin crust. The beer was good; I also got a fun holiday special champagne drink with frozen cranberries and rosemary. We went on a Saturday night and there was a very talented young woman singing, accompanied by a guitarist. It provided a nice ambiance and was not so loud that you couldn‚Äôt talk with your friends. Excellent place to go, morning or night, for good coffee, food and beer. Highly recommend!",

            "text": "The beer was good; found a couple I would drink again! ;) The brewery cats were fun. Our pizza was overpriced and the dough seemed old, it didn't rise in the oven so it was stodgy. The overall sense of humor shown in many of the signs and decorations. I'd go to hang out and try the food trucks in the back!",
