          "text": "This is the worst rental experience we have had. They will repair minor things but nothing important. We had a bathroom flood, not fault of our own, back in September of 2024. I have been patient working to get the company to fix the bathroom flooring that was coming up after that. They claimed they needed to wait until insurance payed out. Several months later insurance paid and all they did was a cosmetic patch on the ceiling‚Ä¶water poured through our kitchen chandelier and multiple places in our ceiling from the flood. When it happened I contact emergency maintenance but they did not consider it an emergency. We bought a carpet cleaning machine to suck water out of the carpets and cleaned up the best we could. The maintenance company has came to look at the flooring several times, they want to fix it. However then property management company refused to approve the repairs needed. Our kitchen floor is peeling up. I have to place a mat over it so we don‚Äôt trip.\n\nWe notified that we will not be resigning our lease due to them not fixing things. Our lease is up July 31st. I just accepted they are hard to work with so will just deal with the issues and not resign. They are already wanting to do showings (60 days before lease is up) and are not willing to ask me times that work. We are working parents and have minors home while at work. I keep voicing I do not feel comfortable with them coming to our home with only minors there. They remind me they have a key so we don‚Äôt need to be there, that doesn‚Äôt address the issue! They have already scheduled 2 showing without asking if the time works. I politely asked for weekend days because minors won‚Äôt be home alone. They continue to schedule on weekdays.\n\nI wanted to be polite and amicable due to needing a good reference for finding a new rental but they are being impossible to work with. I usually don‚Äôt write bad reviews but I am at my wits ends. They ignore all my concerns.",

Throughout our year-long lease, they consistently failed to communicate, delayed maintenance requests by weeks (if they responded at all), and treated us like an inconvenience rather than tenants.\n\nAt move-out, they refused to let us walk through the property and withheld over $600 from our deposit for completely unreasonable charges‚Äîincluding $200 for lightbulbs, when only a few were out. Our lease didn‚Äôt say anything about needing to replace bulbs, but had we known they'd charge triple digits for them, we obviously would‚Äôve handled it ourselves.\n\nThey also tried to charge us $1,500 for a broken garage door we didn‚Äôt break, and it became clear that their goal was to stick tenants with upgrade costs so they could flip the home for resale. It felt dishonest and predatory.\n\nLisa, the manager, speaks to tenants in a condescending tone and was consistently rude during conversations. Bethany, the assistant manager, rarely listened and dismissed our concerns without resolution. Their behavior made it clear that tenant experience is not their priority‚Äîmoney and control are.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend Real Property Management Utah County to anyone. Be cautious, document EVERYTHING, and if you can, avoid renting through them altogether.",

They claimed it was NECESSARY to pay $300 for professional cleaning (800 sq ft place) because they saw a shelf with crumbs. They wouldn‚Äôt tell us the company that went out to clean so we could confirm. We had pics and that place was so much nicer than when we first rented it. And the funny thing is is they used pictures from ANOTHER property for proof. It wasn‚Äôt even our place. They used pics from another rental AND used old pictures from past inspections. We took pictures after TWO DAYS of cleaning and they came became with the pics and none of it matched up. When we asked for more details and for more proof they refused. So $300 for a professional crumb clean up (??!?) They gave us nickels and times back from our deposit and we fought as much as we could. Terrible service. Multiple times we had issues and NEVER did we get them fixed. Like snow and rain blowing in the front door. They wouldn‚Äôt respond or they wouldn‚Äôt send anyone. These people don‚Äôt care they just want to pocket your money. Which the owners who were using them even believed too after we contacted them about the terrible service. I know they might respond and try and cover themselves, but that‚Äôs what they do. I‚Äôve read reviews and agree 10000%. They are liars and will steal your money for themselves.",

Throughout our year-long lease, they consistently failed to communicate, delayed maintenance requests by weeks (if they responded at all), and treated us like an inconvenience rather than tenants.\n\nAt move-out, they refused to let us walk through the property and withheld over $600 from our deposit for completely unreasonable charges‚Äîincluding $200 for lightbulbs, when only a few were out. Our lease didn‚Äôt say anything about needing to replace bulbs, but had we known they'd charge triple digits for them, we obviously would‚Äôve handled it ourselves.\n\nThey also tried to charge us $1,500 for a broken garage door we didn‚Äôt break, and it became clear that their goal was to stick tenants with upgrade costs so they could flip the home for resale. It felt dishonest and predatory.\n\nLisa, the manager, speaks to tenants in a condescending tone and was consistently rude during conversations. Bethany, the assistant manager, rarely listened and dismissed our concerns without resolution. Their behavior made it clear that tenant experience is not their priority‚Äîmoney and control are.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend Real Property Management Utah County to anyone.

          "text": "This is the worst rental experience we have had. They will repair minor things but nothing important. We had a bathroom flood, not fault of our own, back in September of 2024. I have been patient working to get the company to fix the bathroom flooring that was coming up after that. They claimed they needed to wait until insurance payed out. Several months later insurance paid and all they did was a cosmetic patch on the ceiling‚Ä¶water poured through our kitchen chandelier and multiple places in our ceiling from the flood. When it happened I contact emergency maintenance but they did not consider it an emergency. We bought a carpet cleaning machine to suck water out of the carpets and cleaned up the best we could. The maintenance company has came to look at the flooring several times, they want to fix it. However then property management company refused to approve the repairs needed. Our kitchen floor is peeling up. I have to place a mat over it so we don‚Äôt trip.\n\nWe notified that we will not be resigning our lease due to them not fixing things. Our lease is up July 31st. I just accepted they are hard to work with so will just deal with the issues and not resign. They are already wanting to do showings (60 days before lease is up) and are not willing to ask me times that work. We are working parents and have minors home while at work. I keep voicing I do not feel comfortable with them coming to our home with only minors there. They remind me they have a key so we don‚Äôt need to be there, that doesn‚Äôt address the issue! They have already scheduled 2 showing without asking if the time works. I politely asked for weekend days because minors won‚Äôt be home alone. They continue to schedule on weekdays.\n\nI wanted to be polite and amicable due to needing a good reference for finding a new rental but they are being impossible to work with. I usually don‚Äôt write bad reviews but I am at my wits ends. They ignore all my concerns.",

          "text": "Real Property Management Utah County was by far the most difficult rental company we‚Äôve ever dealt with. Throughout our year-long lease, they consistently failed to communicate, delayed maintenance requests by weeks (if they responded at all), and treated us like an inconvenience rather than tenants.\n\nAt move-out, they refused to let us walk through the property and withheld over $600 from our deposit for completely unreasonable charges‚Äîincluding $200 for lightbulbs, when only a few were out. Our lease didn‚Äôt say anything about needing to replace bulbs, but had we known they'd charge triple digits for them, we obviously would‚Äôve handled it ourselves.\n\nThey also tried to charge us $1,500 for a broken garage door we didn‚Äôt break, and it became clear that their goal was to stick tenants with upgrade costs so they could flip the home for resale. It felt dishonest and predatory.\n\nLisa, the manager, speaks to tenants in a condescending tone and was consistently rude during conversations. Bethany, the assistant manager, rarely listened and dismissed our concerns without resolution. Their behavior made it clear that tenant experience is not their priority‚Äîmoney and control are.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend Real Property Management Utah County to anyone. Be cautious, document EVERYTHING, and if you can, avoid renting through them altogether.",

La llave de la ducha siempre estuvo mala, intentaron arreglarla y quedo peor. Al momento del termino del contrato me atrase con la llave por que era dia sabado y la entregue el lunes, me querian cobrar el mes completo de renta y nisiquiera me daban la llave por un mes mas por que segun ellos ya estaban trabajando en el apartamento. Ellos decian que por cobrato debian cobrarme un mes mas por 1 dia de atraso.  Resulta que en el contrato jamas dijo eso, pero no fueron capaces de arreglarme nada via texto tuve que ir a la agencia y recien ahi pude solucionar... si me preguntaran no se la recomiendo a nadie  ni tampoco volveria a rentar con ellos.",

          "text": "This is the worst rental experience we have had. They will repair minor things but nothing important. We had a bathroom flood, not fault of our own, back in September of 2024. I have been patient working to get the company to fix the bathroom flooring that was coming up after that. They claimed they needed to wait until insurance payed out. Several months later insurance paid and all they did was a cosmetic patch on the ceiling‚Ä¶water poured through our kitchen chandelier and multiple places in our ceiling from the flood. When it happened I contact emergency maintenance but they did not consider it an emergency. We bought a carpet cleaning machine to suck water out of the carpets and cleaned up the best we could. The maintenance company has came to look at the flooring several times, they want to fix it. However then property management company refused to approve the repairs needed. Our kitchen floor is peeling up. I have to place a mat over it so we don‚Äôt trip.\n\nWe notified that we will not be resigning our lease due to them not fixing things. Our lease is up July 31st. I just accepted they are hard to work with so will just deal with the issues and not resign. They are already wanting to do showings (60 days before lease is up) and are not willing to ask me times that work. We are working parents and have minors home while at work. I keep voicing I do not feel comfortable with them coming to our home with only minors there. They remind me they have a key so we don‚Äôt need to be there, that doesn‚Äôt address the issue! They have already scheduled 2 showing without asking if the time works. I politely asked for weekend days because minors won‚Äôt be home alone. They continue to schedule on weekdays.\n\nI wanted to be polite and amicable due to needing a good reference for finding a new rental but they are being impossible to work with. I usually don‚Äôt write bad reviews but I am at my wits ends. They ignore all my concerns.",

They claimed it was NECESSARY to pay $300 for professional cleaning (800 sq ft place) because they saw a shelf with crumbs. They wouldn‚Äôt tell us the company that went out to clean so we could confirm. We had pics and that place was so much nicer than when we first rented it. And the funny thing is is they used pictures from ANOTHER property for proof. It wasn‚Äôt even our place. They used pics from another rental AND used old pictures from past inspections. We took pictures after TWO DAYS of cleaning and they came became with the pics and none of it matched up. When we asked for more details and for more proof they refused. So $300 for a professional crumb clean up (??!?) They gave us nickels and times back from our deposit and we fought as much as we could. Terrible service. Multiple times we had issues and NEVER did we get them fixed. Like snow and rain blowing in the front door. They wouldn‚Äôt respond or they wouldn‚Äôt send anyone. These people don‚Äôt care they just want to pocket your money. Which the owners who were using them even believed too after we contacted them about the terrible service. I know they might respond and try and cover themselves, but that‚Äôs what they do. I‚Äôve read reviews and agree 10000%. They are liars and will steal your money for themselves.",

I lost over 5k in rent, and more...\n\nThe worst property management service I have ever used to get my home rented. Here is a quick recap of what you can expect if you use them:\n- Home was not rented - I waited 3 months\n- Even though I asked, advertisements were not ran\n- I had to call in to get updates, and the team was annoyed when I asked what was going on\n- Original receipts for performed work were not provided, and unclear markups were applied without proper documentation.\n- Unauthorized work was conducted beyond the initially approved budget.\n- Despite our agreed-upon parting without fees, I later received a collection notice demanding over $1,000.\n\nThis entire experience was not only financially burdensome but also incredibly frustrating due to the failure on their part to fulfill basic responsibilities. After they were fired my new property manager had a renter in there in 1 week, highlighting a significant difference in performance.",

Boarding up someone's property because you think that there is an illegal substance in the walls without notice, and then not giving them the funds to find a place to stay is incorrigible. Not even 12 hours. To my knowledge they have to be given a 3 day notice and then 30 days if the tenant responds.  Displacing families and pets is not only illegal but just wrong. I would not rent from this company in any instance. They are in it for the money and do not care about their residents in the least. If you want a stable home DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY.",

Raquel walked me through the process patiently and quickly. We have a cat so that was a concern for myself and my Grandaughter. She quickly  found a home for us. Raquel explained exactly what I would need and the time frame. She was the first person I saw when we arrived. She met me early at the office as we arrived at 3 am that morning. I wanted to hug her because I was so relieved to have a home to go to. She went out of her way to get me a shorter lease as I was buying a home that wasn‚Äôt ready. I have complete faith in her as she tries to find some to complete my lease.  I would be very happy to recommend Raquel to help you feel at home. Thank you\nVictoria Amos",

I asked RPM for a one day extension as a one time courtesy since we had been paying on time for 2 years without asking for anything in the past. Raquel quickly replied, confirmed we could and then informed me to reach out once the payment was made so that the fees were reversed. As soon as I made the payment, I messaged back and within 30 minutes Raquel worked with accounting to get the fees taken care of. This relieved a lot of stress for us this month and we truly appreciate RPM & Raquel working with us on this one time issue.",

Throughout our year-long lease, they consistently failed to communicate, delayed maintenance requests by weeks (if they responded at all), and treated us like an inconvenience rather than tenants.\n\nAt move-out, they refused to let us walk through the property and withheld over $600 from our deposit for completely unreasonable charges‚Äîincluding $200 for lightbulbs, when only a few were out. Our lease didn‚Äôt say anything about needing to replace bulbs, but had we known they'd charge triple digits for them, we obviously would‚Äôve handled it ourselves.\n\nThey also tried to charge us $1,500 for a broken garage door we didn‚Äôt break, and it became clear that their goal was to stick tenants with upgrade costs so they could flip the home for resale. It felt dishonest and predatory.\n\nLisa, the manager, speaks to tenants in a condescending tone and was consistently rude during conversations. Bethany, the assistant manager, rarely listened and dismissed our concerns without resolution. Their behavior made it clear that tenant experience is not their priority‚Äîmoney and control are.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend Real Property Management Utah County to anyone.

La llave de la ducha siempre estuvo mala, intentaron arreglarla y quedo peor. Al momento del termino del contrato me atrase con la llave por que era dia sabado y la entregue el lunes, me querian cobrar el mes completo de renta y nisiquiera me daban la llave por un mes mas por que segun ellos ya estaban trabajando en el apartamento. Ellos decian que por cobrato debian cobrarme un mes mas por 1 dia de atraso.  Resulta que en el contrato jamas dijo eso, pero no fueron capaces de arreglarme nada via texto tuve que ir a la agencia y recien ahi pude solucionar... si me preguntaran no se la recomiendo a nadie  ni tampoco volveria a rentar con ellos.",
