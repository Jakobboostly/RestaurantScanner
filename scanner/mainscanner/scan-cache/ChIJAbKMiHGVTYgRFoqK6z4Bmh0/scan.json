It looks like a dive bar with sticky floors and mismatched furniture, but has a rather upscale menu and is definitely pricier than expected.\n\nThey have a great variety of drinks and our cheese board and soup were delicious. The burger was just ok, but the service was great and both our waiter and the hostess were very friendly and welcoming.",

We arrived and were greeted by the host.\n\nThe host verified the table was ready and then we were shown to the table. I had no idea how big this place is! You walk in and there is a bar area, but the restaurant is huge and has a lot of tables.\n\nOur waiter was prompt and and got the beverages going and appetizers ordered. When the restaurant of the party showed up orders were taken. I ordered the risotto with shrimp.\n\nThe wait for the food was less than 30 minutes which was pretty good for a party of 14! The waiter was excellent with refills for drinks.\n\nMy risotto unfortunately did not come with the shrimp as ordered. I also found the dish way too sweet. It was more like a dessert. I was offered a free dessert l, but they ran out of the cake.\n\nWith good service like that I would definitely go back and try the place again. Orders can get mixed up and the customer service shows this place cares about the dining experience.",

I don‚Äôt mind paying a premium for a quality food and drinks, but a bug-infested bar and kitchen is not the move.\n\nI was also disappointed in the service. When I told them about the bugs, they didn‚Äôt seem surprised and offered me a different drink. They didn‚Äôt comp our meals which is not the level of service I expect at this price point.

I don‚Äôt mind paying a premium for a quality food and drinks, but a bug-infested bar and kitchen is not the move.\n\nI was also disappointed in the service. When I told them about the bugs, they didn‚Äôt seem surprised and offered me a different drink. They didn‚Äôt comp our meals which is not the level of service I expect at this price point. Pretty sure even McDonald‚Äôs would have refunded us. Unless you‚Äôre a health inspector, please dine elsewhere.",

Five stars if you have the pallet of an alligator.  I'm not sure if most people who gave this 5 stars have actually cooked their own food (poorly) or they lost their sense of taste due to COVID - but holly salt lick Bat Man!!!!!  Now I will say this, it could have been my order only BUT literally 99% of our group spit out the food and did not eat any more (with the exception of 1 person - who let's face it has not real taste due to COVID - so high salt content would benefit them).  I will say (and the reason it received 2 stars) was due to the service.  The service was amazing - very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - but the food - how do I put a GAG emoji into this post???  Fire the cook (because no Chef would let this dog food come out of the kitchen) and hire someone who actually understands that salt is not a primary food group.",

We arrived and were greeted by the host.\n\nThe host verified the table was ready and then we were shown to the table. I had no idea how big this place is! You walk in and there is a bar area, but the restaurant is huge and has a lot of tables.\n\nOur waiter was prompt and and got the beverages going and appetizers ordered. When the restaurant of the party showed up orders were taken. I ordered the risotto with shrimp.\n\nThe wait for the food was less than 30 minutes which was pretty good for a party of 14! The waiter was excellent with refills for drinks.\n\nMy risotto unfortunately did not come with the shrimp as ordered. I also found the dish way too sweet. It was more like a dessert. I was offered a free dessert l, but they ran out of the cake.\n\nWith good service like that I would definitely go back and try the place again. Orders can get mixed up and the customer service shows this place cares about the dining experience.",

Their sommelier, Ray, is always happy to pair the perfect wine with your dinner selection. Great drink and beer selections, too.",

After seeing the online presence and reviews, in addition to looking at the menu online, all seemed to be set up for us to have an enjoyable experience and maybe even find a new go to when in Blacksburg. When we walked in I knew right away we had made a mistake and we almost turned around, I wish we had. I could have looked over the majority of what I saw as red flags but the most disappointing part was the fact that the place just opened up at 5 for dinner and we were one of the first to sit down. There is no way that the Brussels sprouts and mash potatoes had been made in the last hour much less 4 hours. The meatloaf was a 5 out of 10 at best but the rest of the plate was not even close to something I could manage to eat without gagging (cold, dry and just old in general). I could go on but will leave it at that.",

Still wet and runny. Id requested another, to which still came back same way minus, bacon.\nWife's breakfast potatoes were like croutons instead of soft, hard..\nFor the prices of entrees and restaurant with reservations, you figure that the chef would know how to cook items served.\nBad experience.

(And if you‚Äôre just looking for a refreshing adult beverage or craft beer - Franks Bar inside is ready to quench your thirst) üòéüèÜü¶É",

I feel like the atmosphere of the place is dive bar trying to serve fancy dishes which was my mistake of trying to order a risotto. The risotto was flavorless and the steak as well. I am not picky I‚Äôve been told so my husband was surprised when I didn‚Äôt eat it. The only thing I could eat was the asparagus. (Husband ate steak, but said it was ok). Paid $29 for a dish that was not worth it. Will not return.",

            "text": "First time at this restaurant - it was not busy - I'll come back to see if anything changes BUT if you like SALT and no actual ingredient flavor this place is for you.  Five stars if you have the pallet of an alligator.  I'm not sure if most people who gave this 5 stars have actually cooked their own food (poorly) or they lost their sense of taste due to COVID - but holly salt lick Bat Man!!!!!  Now I will say this, it could have been my order only BUT literally 99% of our group spit out the food and did not eat any more (with the exception of 1 person - who let's face it has not real taste due to COVID - so high salt content would benefit them).  I will say (and the reason it received 2 stars) was due to the service.  The service was amazing - very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - but the food - how do I put a GAG emoji into this post???  Fire the cook (because no Chef would let this dog food come out of the kitchen) and hire someone who actually understands that salt is not a primary food group.",
