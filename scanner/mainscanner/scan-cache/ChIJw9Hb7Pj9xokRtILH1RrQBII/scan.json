The sushi tasted decent but each roll only comes with 6 small pieces. 3 out of the 4 cheesesteak knots were burnt, and they were dry and cold as can be as if they were just sitting out all day and they threw some toppings on it and put it in the oven for the cheese to melt. They definitely weren't fresh garlic knots. Even my 15 year old that loves anything bread or sushi related said it sucked. We expected so much better considering the price and ritzy/snooty area but lesson learned. We'll stick to our usual Omka down the street that never disappoints.",

The sushi tasted decent but each roll only comes with 6 small pieces. 3 out of the 4 cheesesteak knots were burnt, and they were dry and cold as can be as if they were just sitting out all day and they threw some toppings on it and put it in the oven for the cheese to melt. They definitely weren't fresh garlic knots. Even my 15 year old that loves anything bread or sushi related said it sucked. We expected so much better considering the price and ritzy/snooty area but lesson learned. We'll stick to our usual Omka down the street that never disappoints.",
