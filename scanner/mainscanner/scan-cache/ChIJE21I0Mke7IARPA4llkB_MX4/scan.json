One thing I did notice is that you do not need to order extra cheese as that comes standard. So much so that the extra cheese overpowered the entire Pizza and made it to the point that the crust was having a hard time standing up to the weight. I would absolutely order from these folks the next time I'm in town, I just may order my pizza with light cheese. With their layout and I found it enjoyable, overall, I would return.",

Conveniently located within walking distance of the Hilton Garden Inn, it was the perfect spot to unwind.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, Carla (if I caught her name right) welcomed me with such warmth that I immediately felt at home. The Wild West theme, complete with a general store, was a fantastic and unique touch that really sets this place apart. I even learned that this Cracker Barrel store idea was born during the challenges of COVID‚Äîa true testament to resilience and creativity.\n\nAs for the food: incredible! I enjoyed a personal pepperoni and mushroom pizza alongside their buffalo wings. The pizza was bursting with flavor, reminiscent of authentic Chicago-style pies. And the wings? Perfectly cooked, with a sauce so good they practically melted in my mouth.\n\nThis spot is a must-visit, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. I also heard they host poker nights on Thursdays, which sounds like a blast. Hopefully, I‚Äôll get the chance to return and experience that next time. Wild West Pizza & Grill has definitely earned a place on my list of favorites!",

The pizza was served hot and fresh, with good overall flavor.\n\nHowever, it was quite oily and greasy, overloaded with cheese, and noticeably lacking in toppings. At $27 for a medium pizza (substituting roasted tomatoes with mushrooms and adding jalape√±os), it felt overpriced for what we received.\n\nGreat service, but the pizza could use better balance and more value for the price.",

This morning I didn't know this existed, but now I don't think I can live without it. I have truly found my happy place. Then my mind thought what if this was made into a calzone, and instead of the tomato sauce it had a Thai yellow curry to dip it in. Would it instantly transport me to Nirvana. Would I feel true piece. Now I think how did I live not knowing this existed. What else am I missing in my life that I don't even imagine exists. If they made a calzone version with a Thai yellow curry dipping sauce would I be able to die in complete peace, the realization tofu could be a pizza topping, will this calzone journey I will now embark on make all desire leave my soul, and transfer me to a state of absolute piece with the universe? I don't know yet, but I am planning on finding out. I will say that while I am attempting to comprehend Nirvana, and eating this pizza that I didn't know existed, or even imagined, while I realize this may have changed the entire future of my existence i can not longer fathom what joys I have not yet experienced await me in this world. Also a little chili crisp made it even better tasting. Wow!!!",

          "text": "I got the Deadwood Pizza. Great vegetarian option and the pizza was overall pretty solid. One thing I did notice is that you do not need to order extra cheese as that comes standard. So much so that the extra cheese overpowered the entire Pizza and made it to the point that the crust was having a hard time standing up to the weight. I would absolutely order from these folks the next time I'm in town, I just may order my pizza with light cheese. With their layout and I found it enjoyable, overall, I would return.",

Conveniently located within walking distance of the Hilton Garden Inn, it was the perfect spot to unwind.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, Carla (if I caught her name right) welcomed me with such warmth that I immediately felt at home. The Wild West theme, complete with a general store, was a fantastic and unique touch that really sets this place apart. I even learned that this Cracker Barrel store idea was born during the challenges of COVID‚Äîa true testament to resilience and creativity.\n\nAs for the food: incredible! I enjoyed a personal pepperoni and mushroom pizza alongside their buffalo wings. The pizza was bursting with flavor, reminiscent of authentic Chicago-style pies. And the wings? Perfectly cooked, with a sauce so good they practically melted in my mouth.\n\nThis spot is a must-visit, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. I also heard they host poker nights on Thursdays, which sounds like a blast. Hopefully, I‚Äôll get the chance to return and experience that next time. Wild West Pizza & Grill has definitely earned a place on my list of favorites!",

Crispy on the crust, cheese ratio to sauce and toppings was great and if you like a spicy kick, I recommend ordering the jalape√±os from there. The house salad was huge and perfect for an appetizer along with some wings for a big group of people. Service was top notch and owner was kind and accommodating. The pizza came out hot and pretty quick from the time we sat down. There‚Äôs a little store you can browse through while you wait that has a lot of unique gifts/foods.\n\nHighly suggest this place for your next pizza outing!",

The quality shows in not only the taste of the pizza but the way they look too. Of course there is a rise in cost because of the great flavor and produce they put into it. The atmosphere is western hence their name and you'll find photos of old cowboy actors with movie posters on the walls. They have a store area set up in the front very much like Cracker Barrel does but with mostly western type items and toys. They do have four pinball machines and a stuff animals type arcade that you use a mechanical arm to try and grab with. Alcohol is served at an old western style bar. I totally enjoyed the atmosphere and didn't run out of things to look at. We ordered a lot of food and the server was great, very friendly and helpful refilling our drinks. Their bathrooms are single use and very large for anyone using a wheel chair. The men's bathroom was clean and well stocked. The over all restaurant was clean and it gave me an at home type feel.",

He did bring it but it had weed type lettuce on it and was not very good. The pizza was good but ended up being with mainly cheese and pepperoni.

          "text": "I hadn‚Äôt ordered Wild West in years, because it seemed like they stopped delivering outside of DoorDash. When I‚Äôd call, I‚Äôd just wait on hold but no one picked up. So I was pleasantly surprised when, after receiving a mailer, I found their website with online ordering. Ordered some pizza for a reasonable price, but then was disappointed to see it was being delivered via DoorDash. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for local pizza businesses to use DoorDash, because I know they fired their drivers to make the switch. Pizza was still tasty, though smaller than a normal medium, but we were just a little bummed to have that experience.",

But, as Melody mentioned, the pizza was undercooked. We ordered four pizzas and all were doughy, and no char on the bottom.  It was like lightly toasted bread with dough on top and then sauce and toppings.  Definitely could have stayed in the oven maybe another 30 seconds to a minute, or maybe the oven isn‚Äôt hot enough.  The crust was kind of soggy due to not being cooked enough and the pizza really required being eaten with a fork due to no structure.  Get the bake time and temperature right and I‚Äôll be back.",

I've also never encountered a Pizza place with such a creative menu!! All of the things that you would think don't belong on a pizza- they will prove to you that they do. Its one thing to have creative pizzas, it's another thing to execute those ideas beyond belief. Their pizza menu is so vast, everytime I see a pizza and thing \"that's sounds weird as hell\" my next thought is \"let's try it!!\". I'm always adding new favorite pizzas to my list. I have never been let down my a single pizza I've ordered from them. My first \"adventurous\" pizza was the City slicker.... knocked it out of the park... I tried the Annie Oakly after... I was SHOOK by how delicious it was.... digging deeper, I tried the Duke.... I am not a pickle fan, keep in mind.... I like pickles now- but only on this pizza! Hats off to the chef and the creator of these recipes! Grateful that Lompoc has such an OUTSTANDING pizza join! Best in California, if not the world.",

Instead of the crispy, melty deliciousness I had earlier, I received a sloppy soggy version of the same pizza. So disappointing. A few days later one of my coworkers ordered a pizza from them and told me it was sloppy and the crust wasn't fully cooked. Unfortunately, I don't want to risk ordering from here again.

The pizza was served hot and fresh, with good overall flavor.\n\nHowever, it was quite oily and greasy, overloaded with cheese, and noticeably lacking in toppings. At $27 for a medium pizza (substituting roasted tomatoes with mushrooms and adding jalape√±os), it felt overpriced for what we received.\n\nGreat service, but the pizza could use better balance and more value for the price.",
