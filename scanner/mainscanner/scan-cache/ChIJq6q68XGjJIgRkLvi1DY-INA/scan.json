Prime 7 has definitely stepped up its service and menu options at very decent price. The new owner has done an amazing job with renovation of the patio and the old carpet area. Appreciate Lexi our waitress such an amazing girl pleasant to serve us. And the new owner Franco always shaking hands and making sure we are satisfied. Definitely recommend this place and will be back for more.",
