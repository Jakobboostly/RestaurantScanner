We ordered 3-gluten free crust pizzas and the extreme twisted sticks. Overall the flavors just didn‚Äôt happen. Bland on all 3 and the twisted sticks had minimal cheese and no garlic. Thinking maybe the gluten free crust impacted the overall flavor of the pies. They looked delicious, just think for the price there are much better options in Boise.",

He asked for pizza for lunch today so I stopped into Extreme Pizza to hook my husband up.\n\nWalking in, I was greeted and a beautiful smile. The lady that was working was the only person there but she handled business.  There was a gentleman ahead of me. She got his ordered squared away and then got my order taken care of. We talked about the little coffee joint around the corner from her shop. I told her I was going to grabbed a drink and be right back.\n\nBy the time I made it back, my husband's pizza was done.  I have a habit of making sure his food looks like what I had ordered. He works on the other side of town any I don't want to drive back if it's wrong. Opening up that little box, the pizza looked fantastic! There was so much cheese on the pizza.  It was pipping hot just coming out the of oven.\n\nCheese pull was awesome! The crust was chewy and thin.  The sauce had the right amount of tang to it and the cheese was nicely melted all over the pie. With all of it combined in a bite, it was the perfect sweet and savory combo.  I was able to sneak a small bite and it wa so good! I also grabbed a side of homemade ranch and highly recommend dipping that slice into it.\n\nCome to find out the gal that helped me was the owner. She was so sweet and genuine! Business owners like that make me want to support them even more! If you're over by Broadway and Front street and you want a good pie, make sure you check out Extreme Pizza. So good!",

He asked for pizza for lunch today so I stopped into Extreme Pizza to hook my husband up.\n\nWalking in, I was greeted and a beautiful smile. The lady that was working was the only person there but she handled business.  There was a gentleman ahead of me. She got his ordered squared away and then got my order taken care of. We talked about the little coffee joint around the corner from her shop. I told her I was going to grabbed a drink and be right back.\n\nBy the time I made it back, my husband's pizza was done.  I have a habit of making sure his food looks like what I had ordered. He works on the other side of town any I don't want to drive back if it's wrong. Opening up that little box, the pizza looked fantastic! There was so much cheese on the pizza.  It was pipping hot just coming out the of oven.\n\nCheese pull was awesome! The crust was chewy and thin.  The sauce had the right amount of tang to it and the cheese was nicely melted all over the pie. With all of it combined in a bite, it was the perfect sweet and savory combo.  I was able to sneak a small bite and it wa so good! I also grabbed a side of homemade ranch and highly recommend dipping that slice into it.\n\nCome to find out the gal that helped me was the owner. She was so sweet and genuine! Business owners like that make me want to support them even more! If you're over by Broadway and Front street and you want a good pie, make sure you check out Extreme Pizza. So good!",

We ordered 3-gluten free crust pizzas and the extreme twisted sticks. Overall the flavors just didn‚Äôt happen. Bland on all 3 and the twisted sticks had minimal cheese and no garlic. Thinking maybe the gluten free crust impacted the overall flavor of the pies. They looked delicious, just think for the price there are much better options in Boise.",
