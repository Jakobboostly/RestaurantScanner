Loved the honey crust and the service was very nice as well. We will be visiting again soon. Thank you for the great hospitality",

For a restaurant in Colorado, It is not but when you consider that their primary dish is pizza, it is (37$ just for our large). Now that we‚Äôve covered that, it is delicious pizza worth every single dollar! If plain hand tossed or New York style isn‚Äôt your thing, which is what they call Prairie crust, go for the mountain style crust and make sure to throw some honey on it at the end. Just trust me we had a ton of fun eating here. The environment was great. It had a moderate noise level but easy to converse, and the food was absolutely delicious. Get the honey cheese bread and put honey on top of it. Pictured below is the Pacific Plantation in their 3lb (Large) size, fed me and my wife and I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô1‚Äù competition bodybuilder, could easily feed a family of 4! We will return or visit other locations!",

          "text": "I used to love this place and recommended it to others. We made the mistake of ordering a thin crust pizza, and not the original. The dough was still gooey. The cheese was still shredded, not melted together all over. Toppings were dumped on one side primarily and not the other. We sent the pizza back to be cooked. The experience was ruined by then, though,  and the dough did not really cook any more. We went out of our way to eat here, and likely won't do that again.  On a side note, my seat was covered in honey as I found out later. üòÉ Had the waiter been slightly apologetic for anything, I might have left a more positive review. The pizza and sticky seat were not her fault, but she was dismissive of both complaints.  It's ok to make some mistakes, but not half cooked pizza dough with cheese that's not melted all of the way. Working in a kitchen isn't easy, but delivering a cooked pizza should be easily accomplished after all the years they've been in business. I'll just add this: my husband had no problem with the half-cooked crust. The flavor was still true to what we both knew and loved, but again, I prefer a piping hot pizza.",

          "text": "My husband had this place recommended to him, but it turned out to be the worst pizza experience of our lives.\n\nI first ordered an Espresso Martini, but they didn‚Äôt even have coffee liqueur. Then I tried a Margarita, it was the worst I‚Äôve ever had. It was extremely acidic and overly sweet, totally undrinkable. I even went up to the bar to get a glass of soda water to mix it and later asked for another one, but nothing worked, so I basically paid $11 + tax for a drink I couldn‚Äôt even touch. My husband couldn‚Äôt drink it either.\n\nWe ordered the Pacific Plantation, and it was a disaster. The slices fell apart like mush, the sauce was watery and flavorless (just onion), and the pineapple and mushrooms were soggy and bland. It was practically soup, I had to place my slice on a napkin just to try to eat it. The only thing somewhat decent in this ‚Äúpizza pur√©e‚Äù was the pepperoni. Honestly, a frozen pizza, or even a Costco pizza, would have been way better.\n\nTo make matters worse, our server (an older gentleman) seemed annoyed and unfriendly from the start, and we were charged full price at 5:30 pm instead of happy hour.\n\nWe wasted $80 on this terrible experience. 0% recommended. Never again!",

          "text": "I used to love this place and recommended it to others. We made the mistake of ordering a thin crust pizza, and not the original. The dough was still gooey. The cheese was still shredded, not melted together all over. Toppings were dumped on one side primarily and not the other. We sent the pizza back to be cooked. The experience was ruined by then, though,  and the dough did not really cook any more. We went out of our way to eat here, and likely won't do that again.  On a side note, my seat was covered in honey as I found out later. üòÉ Had the waiter been slightly apologetic for anything, I might have left a more positive review. The pizza and sticky seat were not her fault, but she was dismissive of both complaints.  It's ok to make some mistakes, but not half cooked pizza dough with cheese that's not melted all of the way. Working in a kitchen isn't easy, but delivering a cooked pizza should be easily accomplished after all the years they've been in business. I'll just add this: my husband had no problem with the half-cooked crust. The flavor was still true to what we both knew and loved, but again, I prefer a piping hot pizza.",

My family showed up because of a last great experience there by my daughter, unfortunately this time we had brought our dog on the trip. We were informed that we couldn't dine inside or outside, and so spent over $60 bucks for takeout. While waiting for the food we noticed that others had their dogs in the outside seating area on the street, so we asked if we could sit there and enjoy our pizza and the host said ok. Moments later the server for the area came over and said we couldn't sit there for our take out, but may make the concession because they were not busy. It was a really uncomfortable situation, made worse by the fact that all we really wanted to do was to sit there and dine and enjoy their pizza in the first place.\nExceptionally bad customer service. Good pizza, sounds like a moment for staff training",

If you choose to skip out on it, check yourself for other symptoms of hypoxia.\n\nMountain style is basically adding a twisted order of breadsticks to the crust that encircle it like barbed wire on an old fence post. It goes great with the honey on your table and is satisfying to hold.\n\nMy wife has poor genetics and cannot eat gluten, but Beau Jo has magic crust that people with bad genes can also eat. I tried it, it‚Äôs good for magic crust.\n\nYou might be concerned about carbs and calories, but rest assured, *Carbs don‚Äôt count in Colorado.*\n\nPatio seating was a pleasant spot to let 7500ft of elevation downshift my day drinking into economy mode.\n\nChase is a great waitress and we really enjoyed her vibes. Her fun, bubbly attitude really completed it all. Good service is increasingly rare now, so thanks Chase.\n\nTl;dr eat at Beau Jo‚Äôs",

It used to be a treat going to this pizza joint, been going there since the 70s.\nIt‚Äôs soooo crowded, parking can be impossible, be prepared to wait for a table. Once we finally got seated there were so many flies around our table buzzing about, live one‚Äôs & dead ones too. Yuck. The tall guy with long hair literally threw our pizza down onto the table, very rude. Didn‚Äôt speak a word to us. He wasn‚Äôt our waitress,  just dropped off our food‚Ä¶ literally!! The food was meh‚Ä¶ nothing like I remembered. The Beau Joes in Lonetree is better than this experience. Lonetree welcomed us & treated us like they cared. No flies either!\nI spent alot of ‚Äúdough‚Äù there in Idaho Springs, it‚Äôs not cheap to have a family of 5 go out for a special occasion. I expected better based on past years. Idaho Springs is just sooo crowded & combine that with traffic from hell & not so great food- we won‚Äôt be back. ‚òπÔ∏è",

            "text": "My husband had this place recommended to him, but it turned out to be the worst pizza experience of our lives.\n\nI first ordered an Espresso Martini, but they didn‚Äôt even have coffee liqueur. Then I tried a Margarita, it was the worst I‚Äôve ever had. It was extremely acidic and overly sweet, totally undrinkable. I even went up to the bar to get a glass of soda water to mix it and later asked for another one, but nothing worked, so I basically paid $11 + tax for a drink I couldn‚Äôt even touch. My husband couldn‚Äôt drink it either.\n\nWe ordered the Pacific Plantation, and it was a disaster. The slices fell apart like mush, the sauce was watery and flavorless (just onion), and the pineapple and mushrooms were soggy and bland. It was practically soup, I had to place my slice on a napkin just to try to eat it. The only thing somewhat decent in this ‚Äúpizza pur√©e‚Äù was the pepperoni. Honestly, a frozen pizza, or even a Costco pizza, would have been way better.\n\nTo make matters worse, our server (an older gentleman) seemed annoyed and unfriendly from the start, and we were charged full price at 5:30 pm instead of happy hour.\n\nWe wasted $80 on this terrible experience. 0% recommended. Never again!",
