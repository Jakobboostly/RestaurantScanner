The pizza sauce is the right balance. I was thrilled that it wasn't overly sweet like many other places in central Indiana. The bathrooms are super small, but there is a baby changing station in the women's room. We'll definitely be returning in the future.",

The cheese sauce was solid, but the garlic sauce completely stole the show‚Äîit was rich, garlicky, and the perfect dip.\n\nOn top of the great food, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the whole visit even better. The restaurant itself was adorable‚Äîcozy, inviting, and just a fun place to sit and enjoy a meal.\n\nOverall, everything from the food to the atmosphere to the service was spot on.

The cheese sauce was solid, but the garlic sauce completely stole the show‚Äîit was rich, garlicky, and the perfect dip.\n\nOn top of the great food, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the whole visit even better. The restaurant itself was adorable‚Äîcozy, inviting, and just a fun place to sit and enjoy a meal.\n\nOverall, everything from the food to the atmosphere to the service was spot on.

We also tried the cheese bread, which was delicious on its own, but the sauces really took it to the next level. The cheese sauce was solid, but the garlic sauce completely stole the show‚Äîit was rich, garlicky, and the perfect dip.\n\nOn top of the great food, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the whole visit even better. The restaurant itself was adorable‚Äîcozy, inviting, and just a fun place to sit and enjoy a meal.\n\nOverall, everything from the food to the atmosphere to the service was spot on. Definitely a place I‚Äôd recommend and can‚Äôt wait to come back to!",

The pizza was delicious, however I felt the cookie pie was a little grainy but it was still nice and gooey. The hostess was wonderful and the wait was only 10 minutes, incredibly fast for fresh baked items. I will definitely be back!",

From the genuine and sincere smiles of the staff to the what I can only describe as divine pizza. There breadsticks brought a single tear to my eye reminding me of breadsticks I had as a child.\n\nTo say this dining experience is immaculate is an understatement. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. I am excited for my next of many ventures to this absolute gem hidden in Zionsville.",

I also dinged the atmosphere because you couldn't hear anything the person next to you said because of how loud the room was.\n\nP.S. the parking is also a nightmare, but that's not the restaurant's fault.

Cooked the way your grandmother would cook... from scratch.\n\nThe cheese melted over the meatballs and for the cheesy bread is a mouth watering blend of 3 cheeses that is utterly smooth.  The sauce was perfect.  Not hot, not sweet, yet rather a balance of italian flavor and appropriate spices.  No one spice was overpowering.  The flavor danced.",

Our waitress apologized for the delay and took our orders. Drinks were in quick but we had to wait forever for breadsticks! Probably around 30 minutes. Fortunately our kids weren‚Äôt super hungry else we would have walked out. And then the pizza took another 30-40 minutes. They weren‚Äôt busy and we understand that orders can be delayed at any restaurant but this was beyond a reasonable wait time. Also we didn‚Äôt know there was a 4$ surcharge for adding Alfredo sauce to a 8$ kids pasta. 50% surcharge. Should have been specified in the menu. Would have still paid for it but good to know in advance. We intentionally choose local restaurants for our meals but experiences like this make us question our choices.",

I don‚Äôt mind paying for what should be premium food.  We ordered at 5:40 and told it would be about an hour and the address is less than three miles from the restaurant, no problem an hour is expected on a Sunday evening.  After several calls the order showed up at 7:50 well over two hours later. The food was not only cold, but stale.  Sad sad sad, don‚Äôt really understand how these folks stay in business.  We bypassed the chain restaurants to spend and keep our money local, big mistake.  It was horrible and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.   IF could rate them a zero I would.  If you do decide to order from these folks, I would go and pick your order up.  What a waste of $77 not including the tip.  Really made me upset when they told us the order would be there in 5 minutes and it was 40 minutes later when it showed up. Sad, sad ,sad!",

The owner always tries to get to know you a bit more each time you come in. Very friendly service.\nThere are so many topping choices, which is awesome and I like that so much! Love the variety. Peppadew peppers are my fave, paired with pepperoni. Always plenty of cheese which I thoroughly enjoy! I feel like chain pizza places are so skimpy these days and always have to ask for extra and pay more in order to get what is deemed as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.\n\nOverall, love this place!

You have to subscribe to it, and it sends you a text message with a weird web link that takes you to a weird website with a .app domain. Then it gives you a coupon code that expires in an hour. And the discounts aren't even that good. Like if you buy a pizza, you get a 12\" cheese for half price. But you can't use it to online order. So you have to call in your order, then keep that link open in your browser to show them your phone in person when you pick up your pizza.  I just decreased the rating by 2 stars because it is almost like they are trying to discourage you from using it. Or you could pay full price.",

After the ordeal we did not feel it to be in our families best interest to eat the food and ask for our money back from the manager who delivered it, he said NO and pulled out of our driveway. We put it in the trash. THE MANAGER REPRESENTS THE BUSINESS AND HIS TEAM THEY ARE VERY RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, he was AGGRESSIVE, AND MOST OF ALL PREJUDICE!!!!",

The cheese sauce was solid, but the garlic sauce completely stole the show‚Äîit was rich, garlicky, and the perfect dip.\n\nOn top of the great food, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the whole visit even better.
