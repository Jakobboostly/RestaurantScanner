We met our server/bartender who greeted us without hesitation although it was close to closing (without us knowing). He was clearly busy with three other tables/also tending the bar/closing duties- but I never felt rushed in his presence. There was not a wait, and it was if we have been regulars for years- which now I will be. The food was delicious and the drinks were truly superb. I can't wait to bring my family back here!\n\n-Emma",

He told us the story of how they got started and it felt like we had known him for years already! Such an easygoing, friendly atmosphere. The decor is absolutely stunning, I kept thinking that it was plucked straight out of Malibu or Miami. The carne asada tacos are probably the best tacos I have ever had in my life. I was taken aback by the authenticity and flavor of everything we tried. A suggestion - try the smash burger, and ask for the cucumber jalapeno sauce. We bought and took some home with us!",

We met our server/bartender who greeted us without hesitation although it was close to closing (without us knowing). He was clearly busy with three other tables/also tending the bar/closing duties- but I never felt rushed in his presence. There was not a wait, and it was if we have been regulars for years- which now I will be. The food was delicious and the drinks were truly superb. I can't wait to bring my family back here!\n\n-Emma",

But that feeling immediately changed with the proximity of the seating in the center, on the tiny tables.   On top of that, the music was pretty loud, both from the radio and then the live performance of a Billy Joel band at a Mexican taco joint? The food was seasoned well, but everything (literally everything) was served cold.  The fresh chips and salsa? Cold and somewhat stale.  The quesadilla I ordered half beef and half chicken? Good but cold.   The rice bowls.  All with cold meat and rice.    Then the prices! Incredibly expensive for the poor food quality.  Also also, why does it seem to be a Mexican restaurant with no body of any Latino ethnicity in sight? Everybody that came in was the whitest gentric family I've ever seen.  And this place has 5 star glaring ratings? Crazy.  Never going back.  El ranchito remains supreme.   Get good.",

The spicy one was actually spicy!  I know, how could it not be but you will never surprised at how many times we order this at other places and they lack spicy. The blood orange was so good!  It was a nice blend of citrus and sweetness. The bartender, she was super friendly. We also ordered the nachos to share. It is a very large tray to share.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the cost. The nachos were over $20 bucks. I know with cost increasing, this is the new norm but I still find it a bit high for the amount of protein you get.\n\nThe place was clean and the bathrooms.",

Lyon was our server and he was nothing less than personable, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. This was our first time here and even our hard to please toddler was impressed! The taco trio is a must try for a first timer. You can choose your protein (I did chicken, steak, and pork), and they come with different toppings. The pickled veggies on each taco added so much flavor to the proteins. My husband got a pork, bean, and veggies rice bowl (Barria??), which was amazing! It‚Äôs only made on Wednesday so 10/10 recommend. Of course we ordered chips and queso as an appetizer and requested more chip because they weren‚Äôt greasy or topped with oil. The queso was great. The kids menu .. the cheese quesadilla was HUGE hit with our little one. She doesn‚Äôt eat much when we go out to eat, and she ate 3/4 of the quesadilla. And let‚Äôs talk about the churros‚Ä¶ oh my taste buds! Sooooo yummy. All this to say the food, price, service, and atmosphere exceeded any and all expectations!",
