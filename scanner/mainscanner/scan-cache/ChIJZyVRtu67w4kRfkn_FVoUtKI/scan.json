          "text": "UPDATE 6/9/2024\nI am changing my review to 5 stars. I've ordered 4x in the last 6 weeks and each time the food has been great. The staff has been super friendly(they always were), but the food has been delicious.  I got their Monday special for a large classic pie for $10 and it tastes way better than my encounter (found below) from last January. Glad to see their leadership has taken control and changed the quality of food. Will definitely be coming back , also really happy because they are conveniently located for me. Love to support local business.\n\nUPDATE 1/9/23\nOrdered a large pie and there was a piece of pretty long string baked into the crust , under the cheese and integrated into the sauce. I attached photos. Takes away from the entire experience of eating. Not wanting to figure out what else could be in the pie, I discarded it. It's a shame, I keep trying to give this place a chance, it's been hit/miss but these definitely left a bad taste in my mouth (pun totally intended but also sad because it's accurate).\n\nOLD REVIEW\nOrdered 3 items\n1 slice of Margherita pizza = pretty small piece maybe 5\" x 2.5\" what i got instead was white pizza with some pesto on it and a spoonful of sauce .\n1 eggplant Parm sub = large in size but seemed like everything was out of the freezer and fried, not crisp or flavorful.\n1 appetizer I never heard before called long hot peppers and fried potatoes = this was $10 so keep that in mind. Please see the photo. The photo was taken after I ate 3 fries. So 20% was steak fries, 80% was the long peppers. The ratio seems a bit off, the entire dish seems off, figured it was going to be fried peppers and fries (no description is given , so my fault for assuming) but 4 potato wedges vs all those peppers seems totally off.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, recently moved to the area, was looking for a \"go-to\". It has a great location,     I didn't understand why it was a ghost town in there. Until after trying their food. Of course it might have just been an off day, so I will go again (everyone deserves a second chance..., false,  a third or fourth chance :P).",

It was quite disappointing, as I was looking forward to a delicious meal. Additionally, I encountered some issues with the service. The young lady at the register did not seem to provide the level of customer service I would have hoped for. I also noticed that a cook, who appeared to have a physical limitation, was asked to bring my food to the table, which I felt was unnecessary and unkind.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of air conditioning made the dining environment uncomfortable, especially given the high temperatures outside. It felt more like a sauna than a restaurant, which detracted from the overall experience.\n\nI believe that feedback is essential for improvement, and I hope you take this into consideration. Thank you for your attention to these matters.",

          "text": "The food is their own unique thing, not like the standard pizza style of the area.  It's like a really gourmet version of Ellios.  The crispy fried cheese on the edge of the square crust is memorable and different than the soft bread stick that traditionally encircles a NY/NJ slice of pizza, and if you have the open mind for it, it's good.  The sauce wasn't wildly spicy like Pizza Hut or Papa John's but it also wasn't a tangy tart layer of razor thin marinara, like it would be in the regional style.  It was mellow and I detected a saltiness that could have leeched from the chest.  The crust is why I said Ellios. It isn't NY Sicilian style nor Chicago in thickness, but reminds me more of those blowing alley pizzas of the last century.\n\nThe staff were very friendly.  The seating is spacious and comfortable.  But - the color scheme is muted, like the penitentiary feel of a 2023 McDonald's.  I would have given more points for friendly red and white checkerboard patterns or even just the lack of the color black.  Trying to appear new and hip shouldn't mean making people's seasonal affective disorder worse.  Buy a can of red or green paint and go nuts, guys.  One more cookie cutter hip black restaurant is like one more pair of white briefs on the pizza arse of America.\n\nUpdate: I went back to try that chicken.  It came in the form of a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich, which had a nice sauce but fresh mozzarella, which is tasteless when melted.  Indeed, it does have seasoned breading, and all the more interesting that it's seasoned panko bread, which deserves recognition for being seasoned despite being panko.",

The staff has been super friendly(they always were), but the food has been delicious.  I got their Monday special for a large classic pie for $10 and it tastes way better than my encounter (found below) from last January. Glad to see their leadership has taken control and changed the quality of food. Will definitely be coming back , also really happy because they are conveniently located for me. Love to support local business.\n\nUPDATE 1/9/23\nOrdered a large pie and there was a piece of pretty long string baked into the crust , under the cheese and integrated into the sauce. I attached photos. Takes away from the entire experience of eating. Not wanting to figure out what else could be in the pie, I discarded it. It's a shame, I keep trying to give this place a chance, it's been hit/miss but these definitely left a bad taste in my mouth (pun totally intended but also sad because it's accurate).\n\nOLD REVIEW\nOrdered 3 items\n1 slice of Margherita pizza = pretty small piece maybe 5\" x 2.5\" what i got instead was white pizza with some pesto on it and a spoonful of sauce .\n1 eggplant Parm sub = large in size but seemed like everything was out of the freezer and fried, not crisp or flavorful.\n1 appetizer I never heard before called long hot peppers and fried potatoes = this was $10 so keep that in mind. Please see the photo. The photo was taken after I ate 3 fries. So 20% was steak fries, 80% was the long peppers. The ratio seems a bit off, the entire dish seems off, figured it was going to be fried peppers and fries (no description is given , so my fault for assuming) but 4 potato wedges vs all those peppers seems totally off.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, recently moved to the area, was looking for a \"go-to\". It has a great location,     I didn't understand why it was a ghost town in there. Until after trying their food. Of course it might have just been an off day, so I will go again (everyone deserves a second chance..., false,  a third or fourth chance :P).",

          "text": "The food is their own unique thing, not like the standard pizza style of the area.  It's like a really gourmet version of Ellios.  The crispy fried cheese on the edge of the square crust is memorable and different than the soft bread stick that traditionally encircles a NY/NJ slice of pizza, and if you have the open mind for it, it's good.  The sauce wasn't wildly spicy like Pizza Hut or Papa John's but it also wasn't a tangy tart layer of razor thin marinara, like it would be in the regional style.  It was mellow and I detected a saltiness that could have leeched from the chest.  The crust is why I said Ellios. It isn't NY Sicilian style nor Chicago in thickness, but reminds me more of those blowing alley pizzas of the last century.\n\nThe staff were very friendly.  The seating is spacious and comfortable.  But - the color scheme is muted, like the penitentiary feel of a 2023 McDonald's.  I would have given more points for friendly red and white checkerboard patterns or even just the lack of the color black.  Trying to appear new and hip shouldn't mean making people's seasonal affective disorder worse.  Buy a can of red or green paint and go nuts, guys.  One more cookie cutter hip black restaurant is like one more pair of white briefs on the pizza arse of America.\n\nUpdate: I went back to try that chicken.  It came in the form of a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich, which had a nice sauce but fresh mozzarella, which is tasteless when melted.  Indeed, it does have seasoned breading, and all the more interesting that it's seasoned panko bread, which deserves recognition for being seasoned despite being panko.",
