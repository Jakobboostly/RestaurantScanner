          "text": "Had a nice dinner at Etch last night with my wife‚Äîclose to the Country Music Hall of Fame (could\nmake for a good combo)\n\nWe ordered the beet salad, scallops, and the filet‚Äîand honestly, each dish had its moment.\n\nStarted with the Beet & Berry Salad, though calling it a ‚Äúbeet salad‚Äù might be generous‚Äîthere were just a couple of lonely beet slices and more greens. The goat cheese semifreddo? Tasted more like a frozen cheesecake than goat cheese‚Ä¶ which I guess might be the point? Overall, the salad leaned very sweet, between the berries and the semifreddo, and felt like it was missing a little acidity to balance things out.\n\nThe mains, though, were strong. The scallops were beautifully cooked‚Äîtender, buttery, and the kind of dish that makes you pause mid-convo. The filet was just as solid‚Äîjuicy, tender, and backed up by some great sauces: beef jus, red wine gastrique, and a tarragon shallot butter.\n\nService was friendly and on top of things, but the vibe felt a little... office building or corporate.\n\nAll in all, good food and solid execution, but for $214 before tip ($258 all in for one salad, two entr√©es, two wines and a cocktail), I had to go with 4 stars. Worth trying, but you‚Äôre definitely paying downtown Nashville prices. Photo Note: We shared everything and they were happy to split it on two plates. BTW: One extra scallop they up charged us $13. Server said $8, so that was a bit of a miss as well - $64 for 4 scallops? Crazy times.",

We had a couple with dinner.\n\nWe started with their tried and true Octopus and Shrimp bruschetta, Spectacular!!!  We also had the duck tart.  Also amazing!!\n\nWe had a concert to get to so we were in a little bit of a hurry but Josh made sure we were well taken care of and on time.  We had the chefs creation, swordfish over succotash and the trio de setas.  Amazing depth of flavor in both and we thoroughly enjoyed them.\n\nWe received a quick bite of chocolate üç´ ice cream with their house granola that was fantastic before heading off to the concert. We look forward to coming again and sitting and enjoying a few more items. Deb definitely has an amazing restaurant she has created!!",

Here‚Äôs the uncensored rundown:\n‚Ä¢\tFood Disaster: First dish came out astonishingly over-salted. Sent it back. The replacement: still a salty mess. At that point, I gave up complaining‚Äîclearly, the kitchen doesn‚Äôt grasp moderation. Some items might have been burnt. It was a flavor letdown from start to finish.\n‚Ä¢      Inferno Indoors: The temperature inside was genuinely uncomfortable. I saw staff looking wilted from the unbearable heat. It felt like Etch‚Äôs ventilation or AC was completely shot, making the place reek of garlic from the open kitchen more than ever before. A little aroma is welcome, but last night‚Äôs suffocating garlic cloud was overpowering and distracting.\n‚Ä¢\tStaffing Shortfall: Service felt stretched, and the back-of-house seemed just as stressed. When food quality tanks and plates keep coming out wrong, it‚Äôs a sure sign of management not caring enough.\n\nManagement: Your restaurant‚Äôs got a reputation to protect. Don‚Äôt let it slip away because of bad air, burnt food, and gallon buckets of salt.",

Incredible balance and much appreciated. I'm used to the usual 'happy such and such event' written on the dessert plate, or the candle in the cheesecake, but this was far more delicate and intentional.\n\nNow it must be said; and it needs to take a portion of this review... Justin, brother, you made the entire experience what it should always be.\nFrom the kind questions you asked about us and our anniversary, to the shared joy of us both being new parents and all the joys that come with it. And of course, the test of knowledge between two fellow food and drink lovers, I was thoroughly challenged and impressed. Thank you for treating us not as mere customers, but as if we were long time friends. Whether it's policy or not, the complementary mocktail for my pregnant wife without prompting was not only delicious and unique in flavor, but wholly appreciated as she got to feel included in what she and I call the 'special drink' part of the evening.\n\nWithout boring anyone, we ordered the everything seasoned rolls, duck tart, and a shared beet/berry salad to start. Simplicity always wins, especially when you can balance flavors, accomplish intrigue, and please the eye all at the same time. The flavors were complex enough to feel novel, the textures weren't overdone, and the semifreddo utilizing goat cheese was that hint of eclectic I came to love.\n\nEntrees were:\nThe classic filet mignon, with a near perfect gastrique and well prepared broccolini, and the ever clever dots of bright carrot dijon. Beautiful in visuals, classically delicious in flavor.\nAnd the chef's special of the evening, the yellow tail over an asian fris√©e salad was simple, properly prepared, and dusted nicely for texture. It's hard to comment on how good the flavor was as the dish appeared to be already consumed before I gave it much more thought. We'll consider that a win.\n\nI may have gone overboard with the sides but there are no regrets. A special thank you to the kitchen for your special gift to me, to those of you who worked tonight, thank you, it's small gestures that really make you stand apart not only as a restaurant but as a fully integrated staff focused on guest care.\n\nWhile dessert may not have been the highlight, seeing as our bellies were full, our hearts were warm, and our palates treated exquisitely... We were yet again impressed by the simplicity of a polenta cake that satisfied that warm/cold nostalgic dessert with the texture of a cornbread, the delicate quenelle of fennel ice cream, and the decadent peach caramel sauce.\n\nI cannot implore one enough to, at the very least, save your money... and spend it here.\n\nThe guest care, option to watch the kitchen in action, knowledgeable and personable staff? Great reason to visit. Food that doesn't aim to satisfy ostentatious attitudes, but instead focuses on preserving inventiveness and staying true to the title of eclectic without sacrificing flavor or wandering into the 'weird for weird's sake'? Quite possibly the reason you'll keep coming back.\n\nI look forward to our next visit, and again, Deb Paquette, you've got something to be proud of.",

I brought my family to this restaurant, only to be refused service because the staff couldn‚Äôt understand my Tennessee driver license. It has a military restriction code 30, which clearly indicates I‚Äôm on active duty.\n\nDespite explaining this, the bartender, manager, and GM all refused to serve me. So we left and took our business to the Hampton restaurant instead.\n\nIt was an embarrassing experience for my family. Completely unacceptable. I won‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone.\n\nFor future reference, a quick Google search or even a call to local law enforcement would‚Äôve cleared it up.

I should not have to offer alternative ID or defend my legitimacy. I didn‚Äôt use a fake ID, and I didn‚Äôt approach anyone aggressively. Your establishment had just opened for the day at 4:30, and you had every opportunity to handle the situation professionally.\n\nInstead, you chose to double down with excuses.

          "text": "Had a nice dinner at Etch last night with my wife‚Äîclose to the Country Music Hall of Fame (could\nmake for a good combo)\n\nWe ordered the beet salad, scallops, and the filet‚Äîand honestly, each dish had its moment.\n\nStarted with the Beet & Berry Salad, though calling it a ‚Äúbeet salad‚Äù might be generous‚Äîthere were just a couple of lonely beet slices and more greens. The goat cheese semifreddo? Tasted more like a frozen cheesecake than goat cheese‚Ä¶ which I guess might be the point? Overall, the salad leaned very sweet, between the berries and the semifreddo, and felt like it was missing a little acidity to balance things out.\n\nThe mains, though, were strong. The scallops were beautifully cooked‚Äîtender, buttery, and the kind of dish that makes you pause mid-convo. The filet was just as solid‚Äîjuicy, tender, and backed up by some great sauces: beef jus, red wine gastrique, and a tarragon shallot butter.\n\nService was friendly and on top of things, but the vibe felt a little... office building or corporate.\n\nAll in all, good food and solid execution, but for $214 before tip ($258 all in for one salad, two entr√©es, two wines and a cocktail), I had to go with 4 stars. Worth trying, but you‚Äôre definitely paying downtown Nashville prices. Photo Note: We shared everything and they were happy to split it on two plates. BTW: One extra scallop they up charged us $13. Server said $8, so that was a bit of a miss as well - $64 for 4 scallops? Crazy times.",

Loved contrasting flavors & varying textures within the salad. Filet mignon was tasty and my decaf coffee with Bailey's & Frangelico was piping hot as requested. My rating for food & atmosphere is as such because the portions are extremely small and the entire restaurant is frigid. My entree was cold upon receipt:( The coffee order was in attempt to warm myself. All in all the experience was good. Brook was the cherry on top!",

Here is a specific....Lisa greeted us before taking the drink order asking, \"any dietary restrictions or needs?\"   Then she AND the manger made a point of unobtrusively assuring us that the food we were eating would be safe and cause no problems for any of the diners.  The chefs and kitchen staff went to extraordinary lengths to present the food with anything close to a questionable ingredient isolated for those who could eat it while taking care of those who could not!

          "text": "My first visit to Nashville as a woman of color. I like nice things so when I read the reviews for this restaurant I excitedly came in for the happy hour a couple hours after landing--my FIRST Nash experience and it was TERRIBLE. I sat at the bar and the bartenders didn't even acknowledge me. A few minutes later I had to ASK to see a menu... was given the regular menu but not the Happy Hour one that everyone else at the bar had. I had to ASK for the happy hour menu which the bartender seemed annoyed by. I ordered the \"cocktail of the day\" which was mentioned as being an Old Fashioned.. received a pink drink in a martini looking glass so I let the bartender know I ordered the cocktail of the day which was an OF--he was visibly upset and acted as if this was my error. He begrudgingly said \"I can make you a new one if you don't want that\" as if he was doing me a favor. CLEARLY,  not what I ordered young guy. THEN, he made a \"joke\" to the \"Regular\" seated next to me saying \"do you know her?\" when she replied \"no\" he said \"well then we can be mean to her.\" WOW. You don't know me and these passive aggressive jokes are NOT funny.  I've never felt so unwelcomed in an establishment. And the more time I spent in Nashville I realized there were probably some racist undertones there. Great concept, TERRIBLE etiquette & service. Train staff to do a better job at welcoming people of ALL colors and backgrounds, not just the white folk seated at the bar.",

The bruschetta was huge and soggy. The octopus hadn't seen a sear in its life...it looked boiled. We sat for 45 minutes before we got our first bite of food. The waiter forgot to put in our appetizer order, and abandoned our drinks at the bar for 20 minutes. He also shook his head at us and gave us sass when we asked why our drinks hadn't shown up. The decor is non existent. I just don't get it. This place isn't terrible, but it's also not a good restaurant for the price.",

A combination of good food and good service need to work together for an enjoyable meal especially at this price level. While the food was good if overly salty, some combination of server, kitchen prep and food delivery to table was extremely inadequate. As the meal went on, the service degenerated to the point where I was probably visably stunned by the extremely long wait for our entree. Worse, no one seemed to notice and if they did notice,  didn't care. I was so looking forward to dining at Etch but went home a very unhappy camper.",

Here‚Äôs the uncensored rundown:\n‚Ä¢\tFood Disaster: First dish came out astonishingly over-salted. Sent it back. The replacement: still a salty mess. At that point, I gave up complaining‚Äîclearly, the kitchen doesn‚Äôt grasp moderation. Some items might have been burnt. It was a flavor letdown from start to finish.\n‚Ä¢      Inferno Indoors: The temperature inside was genuinely uncomfortable. I saw staff looking wilted from the unbearable heat. It felt like Etch‚Äôs ventilation or AC was completely shot, making the place reek of garlic from the open kitchen more than ever before. A little aroma is welcome, but last night‚Äôs suffocating garlic cloud was overpowering and distracting.\n‚Ä¢\tStaffing Shortfall: Service felt stretched, and the back-of-house seemed just as stressed. When food quality tanks and plates keep coming out wrong, it‚Äôs a sure sign of management not caring enough.\n\nManagement: Your restaurant‚Äôs got a reputation to protect. Don‚Äôt let it slip away because of bad air, burnt food, and gallon buckets of salt.",

            "text": "Finally had a chance to take military leave and return to my home state of Tennessee. I brought my family to this restaurant, only to be refused service because the staff couldn‚Äôt understand my Tennessee driver license. It has a military restriction code 30, which clearly indicates I‚Äôm on active duty.\n\nDespite explaining this, the bartender, manager, and GM all refused to serve me. So we left and took our business to the Hampton restaurant instead.\n\nIt was an embarrassing experience for my family. Completely unacceptable. I won‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone.\n\nFor future reference, a quick Google search or even a call to local law enforcement would‚Äôve cleared it up. I guess I should be flattered they think I look under 21.\n\nSave your money and go somewhere that is worth it.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\nUnfortunately, I‚Äôm unable to respond directly to Allison‚Äôs message, but let‚Äôs call this what it is ‚Äî just another excuse to save face online.\n\nI‚Äôm going to share the truth about how your staff treated a service member returning home with his wife and children. If your goal was to accommodate, you completely failed.\n\nI presented my valid Tennessee driver license, which includes a military restriction code that identifies me as active duty. I should not have to offer alternative ID or defend my legitimacy. I didn‚Äôt use a fake ID, and I didn‚Äôt approach anyone aggressively. Your establishment had just opened for the day at 4:30, and you had every opportunity to handle the situation professionally.\n\nInstead, you chose to double down with excuses. If that‚Äôs the standard you hold, then it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre not ready to welcome all guests. Thankfully, Nashville has plenty of other options. I took my family somewhere that values both their customers and those who serve this country.",

            "text": "My first visit to Nashville as a woman of color. I like nice things so when I read the reviews for this restaurant I excitedly came in for the happy hour a couple hours after landing--my FIRST Nash experience and it was TERRIBLE. I sat at the bar and the bartenders didn't even acknowledge me. A few minutes later I had to ASK to see a menu... was given the regular menu but not the Happy Hour one that everyone else at the bar had. I had to ASK for the happy hour menu which the bartender seemed annoyed by. I ordered the \"cocktail of the day\" which was mentioned as being an Old Fashioned.. received a pink drink in a martini looking glass so I let the bartender know I ordered the cocktail of the day which was an OF--he was visibly upset and acted as if this was my error. He begrudgingly said \"I can make you a new one if you don't want that\" as if he was doing me a favor. CLEARLY,  not what I ordered young guy. THEN, he made a \"joke\" to the \"Regular\" seated next to me saying \"do you know her?\" when she replied \"no\" he said \"well then we can be mean to her.\" WOW. You don't know me and these passive aggressive jokes are NOT funny.  I've never felt so unwelcomed in an establishment. And the more time I spent in Nashville I realized there were probably some racist undertones there. Great concept, TERRIBLE etiquette & service. Train staff to do a better job at welcoming people of ALL colors and backgrounds, not just the white folk seated at the bar.",
