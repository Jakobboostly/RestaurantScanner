A table near me had slices of pizza and they were HUGE and I could hear the table talking about how yummy they were. I will definitely be back. My server was very kind and attentive.

Last night I was picking up and the togo girl was super friendly, even while dealing with challenging customers that were upset with their wait time.  Granted it was Saturday Night and the business was busy...tells me they are doing something right!  I'm patient and the pizza was worth my short wait...and the girl working the togo counter was extremely polite, poised, & professional even while dealing with adversity.  Shame on folks without patience & understanding...the food was great both times!",

I left my keys there and didn't realize it because my wife had the keyless fob in her purse so my vehicle still unlocked and started for entire weekend doing errands. The following week I looked everywhere.  Backtracking I finally called Scuola and they held them for the entire time.  Very cool.  That gave us an excuse to dine there again.  Try the appetizer they light on fire if your a cheese lover but be prepared to share it's a ton. Every dish is amazing.  From salad to entrees you can't go wrong.",

The pictures on the walls confused us because they were about reading and math.  They also had books to read for the kids.  Once we realized Scuola means School in Italian that made sense.  Also we were expecting typical Italian options.  This is more of a Mediterranean menu with many Greek choices to compliment the Italian choices.\n\nWe started with a side of meatballs (SHHH! not on the menu).  They were very good and would order again.  We then got a large Lil Sicily. Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Ricotta Cheese, Oregano and Basil. Loved the crust. A large was too large for two so next time we will get a regular.  But looking forward to leftovers.\n\nWhile the name says school its a definite date night location for us in the near future.  We look forward to tasting some Greek when we we do.",
