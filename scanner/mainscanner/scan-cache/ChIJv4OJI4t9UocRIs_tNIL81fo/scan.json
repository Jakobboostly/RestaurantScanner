The crust is light, ingredients are fresh, and the cheese ratio is just right. It is not greasy in any way. We‚Äôd never been here before but bought a pizza to deliver to a friend that was moving and that lived close by. It looked and smelled so great, we returned and bought our family three of our own.

          "text": "This order was carryout.  The owner of this place has found a real arbitrage opportunity - buy Costco pizza and sell it for 5x the price.  This pizza was SO mid - I could not in good conscience recommend it to anyone.  The other food on the menu must be great for it to have this many stars, or they're giving out free food for positive reviews.  We got Ultimate Pepperoni, Margherita, Cheese, cheesy  bread, and the cinnamon sugar dessert pizza.  First, the pizza literally tasted like...well...not much of anything.  Just really bland, like Costco or Sam's Club pizza.  The texture, the flavor, everything.  Mid.  And for $28 for a \"16 inch\" pizza, I expect something good, if not dynamite.  This is like cafeteria food.  Admittedly, we are from the East coast, so maybe this is just the non-chain pizza experience in Utah?  The second thing to talk about is  the \"16 inch\" pizza.  I've noticed in Utah that people don't really understand the concept of the Imperial Pizza System of Measurement (e.g. The Pie Pizzaria has this issue, I've measured).  16\" pizzas should be that size after it's cooked.  This 16\" is more like a large from Papa Johns.  It MIGHT have been 16\" at some point though.\nThe only slightly redeeming thing was the dessert pizza, which was actually pretty tasty.  The crust was a bit dry, but overall it was good.\nRE: the pizza - the kids were groaning and barely ate anything and we all felt gross after dinner.  As is the way of our days, the ordering website (grubhub) asked for a tip prior to providing any service, but that's another conversation.  Here's a tip though: Save your hard earned money and spend it on better pizza somewhere else, if such a thing exists here.  Or maybe just order from a national pizza chain, where at least you won't pay a premium.",

It is healthier for you. I love sourdough anything so I am so glad to have found sourdough pizza!  Staff were very friendly and gave me a cool punch card where each time you spend 10$ you get a punch and eventually you get something free. Love it and will definitely be back",

This pizza was SO mid - I could not in good conscience recommend it to anyone.  The other food on the menu must be great for it to have this many stars, or they're giving out free food for positive reviews.  We got Ultimate Pepperoni, Margherita, Cheese, cheesy  bread, and the cinnamon sugar dessert pizza.  First, the pizza literally tasted like...well...not much of anything.  Just really bland, like Costco or Sam's Club pizza.  The texture, the flavor, everything.  Mid.  And for $28 for a \"16 inch\" pizza, I expect something good, if not dynamite.  This is like cafeteria food.  Admittedly, we are from the East coast, so maybe this is just the non-chain pizza experience in Utah?  The second thing to talk about is  the \"16 inch\" pizza.  I've noticed in Utah that people don't really understand the concept of the Imperial Pizza System of Measurement (e.g. The Pie Pizzaria has this issue, I've measured).  16\" pizzas should be that size after it's cooked.  This 16\" is more like a large from Papa Johns.  It MIGHT have been 16\" at some point though.\nThe only slightly redeeming thing was the dessert pizza, which was actually pretty tasty.  The crust was a bit dry, but overall it was good.\nRE: the pizza - the kids were groaning and barely ate anything and we all felt gross after dinner.  As is the way of our days, the ordering website (grubhub) asked for a tip prior to providing any service, but that's another conversation.  Here's a tip though: Save your hard earned money and spend it on better pizza somewhere else, if such a thing exists here.  Or maybe just order from a national pizza chain, where at least you won't pay a premium.",
