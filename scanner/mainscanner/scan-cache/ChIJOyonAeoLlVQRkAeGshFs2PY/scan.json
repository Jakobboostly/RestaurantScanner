And don't even try to order the pancit... it's has a horrible taste. Not even close to the real pancit. Their turon does have a little spoiled banana inside and was burnt when they cooked it. The ice cream is not an ice cream,  it's a Slurppy. There's nothing really good to eat on their Combo Meals. Disgusting and disappointing. We went there hungry and we left so angry.

And don't even try to order the pancit... it's has a horrible taste. Not even close to the real pancit. Their turon does have a little spoiled banana inside and was burnt when they cooked it. The ice cream is not an ice cream,  it's a Slurppy. There's nothing really good to eat on their Combo Meals. Disgusting and disappointing. We went there hungry and we left so angry. Please don't waste your money. Most of our food went down to the garbage can.",
