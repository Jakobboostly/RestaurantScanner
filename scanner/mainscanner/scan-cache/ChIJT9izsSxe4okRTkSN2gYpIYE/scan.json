We sat at the bar, were greeted and quickly given menus. The bartender was a sweetheart. Attentive but not so much you're trying to talk while stuffing your face.  Drinks were great- I got some sort of passionfruit mixy.\nBF got the dry rub tenders app as his meal. I got the buff chx sandwich w/ sweet fries.\nThey accidentally gave me regular fries which worked out actually, then my bf could have them w his meal :-)\nHe said the tenders had a nice spice but not too hot.\nThe sandwich was SO good- buff chx fried with slaw and jalapenos. I GOBBLED the whole thing.\nI absolutely loved the warm atmosphere in this place- plenty to look and giggle at while waiting for your meal. Love the touch of the news paper under the fries too.\nWe don't really go to that area, but will be headed back if we do for SURE!",

Drinks were great- I got some sort of passionfruit mixy.\nBF got the dry rub tenders app as his meal. I got the buff chx sandwich w/ sweet fries.\nThey accidentally gave me regular fries which worked out actually, then my bf could have them w his meal :-)\nHe said the tenders had a nice spice but not too hot.\nThe sandwich was SO good- buff chx fried with slaw and jalapenos. I GOBBLED the whole thing.\nI absolutely loved the warm atmosphere in this place- plenty to look and giggle at while waiting for your meal.

We sat at the bar, were greeted and quickly given menus. The bartender was a sweetheart. Attentive but not so much you're trying to talk while stuffing your face.  Drinks were great- I got some sort of passionfruit mixy.\nBF got the dry rub tenders app as his meal. I got the buff chx sandwich w/ sweet fries.\nThey accidentally gave me regular fries which worked out actually, then my bf could have them w his meal :-)\nHe said the tenders had a nice spice but not too hot.\nThe sandwich was SO good- buff chx fried with slaw and jalapenos. I GOBBLED the whole thing.\nI absolutely loved the warm atmosphere in this place- plenty to look and giggle at while waiting for your meal. Love the touch of the news paper under the fries too.\nWe don't really go to that area, but will be headed back if we do for SURE!",
