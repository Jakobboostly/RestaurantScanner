          "text": "Fat Daddy‚Äôs nails what most places miss: a proper New York-style crust with real chew, a light crisp on the bottom, and balance. Not a cracker. Not a loaf. Just right. The dough is made in-house and hand-tossed, and you taste it in every bite. Sauce is clean and bright. Toppings land evenly. My table went classic and it was ü§åüèº\n\nMenu depth is real. You‚Äôve got the ‚ÄúClassics‚Äù for purists, plus a long list of signatures if you want to wander. There are also vegan and gluten-free friendly options, so everyone at the table can eat without drama. If you want to keep it simple, a cheese or pepperoni here is exactly what you hope it will be.\n\nService matched the food: quick, friendly, and on it. The space has an easygoing, retro vibe with 80s touches and even arcade nods, which keeps kids happy and gives groups a place to settle in. There‚Äôs plenty of seating and a private-party setup if you‚Äôre wrangling a crew. This is downtown Provo on Center Street, and it fits the neighborhood well.\n\nBottom line: Fat Daddy‚Äôs is where I‚Äôd bring family, teams, youth groups, or friends who just want excellent pizza and a laid-back room. It‚Äôs not aiming for date-night mood lighting, and that‚Äôs fine. Come hungry, order a couple classics, and let the crust do the talking.",

Pretty good pizza, we got two XLs (half Tough Guy and half Superstar, and a Texan) the Tough Guy was great, Superstar was good, and the Texan was good. The bbq sauce is sweet baby rays and is great! Needed a bit more cheese though. Nothing special but better than fast food pizza places.\nService seems a bit disorganized and we had to wait for a bunch of people to be sat before we could pay and leave. Our server was standing around a lot and we had to waive him down. Hostess seemed overworked and was doing a great job helping everyone.",

We ordered ahead and were told our pizza would be ready at 5:31. I even received a text at 5:38 saying the order was ready....but we didn‚Äôt actually leave with our food until 6:05. That‚Äôs a 34-minute delay past the promised time!! Meanwhile, multiple pizza boxes were just sitting on the warmer, staff were walking around with no urgency, and there were only three families dining in. We saw plenty of dishes going out to the dine-in tables, and two separate parties who arrived 15‚Äì20 minutes after us got their food and left before we did!! When I asked about our order, the employee said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out.‚Äù Not exactly comforting after waiting so long! When we arrived home? It got worse. Our pizza was soggy! The last time the same pizza, perfect crisp. Can't decide if it's because it wasn't cooked enough OR if it sat forever.\n\nWe really expected better, especially based on our first visit. This experience felt disorganized, uncommunicative, and frustrating from start to finish.",

The dough is made in-house and hand-tossed, and you taste it in every bite. Sauce is clean and bright. Toppings land evenly. My table went classic and it was ü§åüèº\n\nMenu depth is real. You‚Äôve got the ‚ÄúClassics‚Äù for purists, plus a long list of signatures if you want to wander. There are also vegan and gluten-free friendly options, so everyone at the table can eat without drama. If you want to keep it simple, a cheese or pepperoni here is exactly what you hope it will be.\n\nService matched the food: quick, friendly, and on it. The space has an easygoing, retro vibe with 80s touches and even arcade nods, which keeps kids happy and gives groups a place to settle in. There‚Äôs plenty of seating and a private-party setup if you‚Äôre wrangling a crew. This is downtown Provo on Center Street, and it fits the neighborhood well.\n\nBottom line: Fat Daddy‚Äôs is where I‚Äôd bring family, teams, youth groups, or friends who just want excellent pizza and a laid-back room. It‚Äôs not aiming for date-night mood lighting, and that‚Äôs fine. Come hungry, order a couple classics, and let the crust do the talking.",

My girlfriend got the wings and fries and I got a pizza. 10 minutes later the wings and fries come out which I was like okay kind of weird to only bring one persons food out but okay. Then this is where things got frustrating . The server did not come and check in on us . My girlfriend wanted ketchup for her fries and it took 10 minutes for him to come back. Keep in mind there are 2 other tables in the restaurant. Now this is the part that really frustrates me. It took 30 minutes for a medium pizza. There was 2 other tables there and they both had their food already. So that means the cooks either just didn‚Äôt make the order because they were lazy or they weren‚Äôt paying attention. I worked in the restaurant industry for 6 years and never once have known anywhere to bake a pizza for more than 15 minutes. The server barely even offered condolences about the time it took. I just don‚Äôt understand how this can be acceptable",

We ordered ahead and were told our pizza would be ready at 5:31. I even received a text at 5:38 saying the order was ready....but we didn‚Äôt actually leave with our food until 6:05. That‚Äôs a 34-minute delay past the promised time!! Meanwhile, multiple pizza boxes were just sitting on the warmer, staff were walking around with no urgency, and there were only three families dining in. We saw plenty of dishes going out to the dine-in tables, and two separate parties who arrived 15‚Äì20 minutes after us got their food and left before we did!! When I asked about our order, the employee said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out.‚Äù Not exactly comforting after waiting so long! When we arrived home? It got worse. Our pizza was soggy! The last time the same pizza, perfect crisp. Can't decide if it's because it wasn't cooked enough OR if it sat forever.\n\nWe really expected better, especially based on our first visit. This experience felt disorganized, uncommunicative, and frustrating from start to finish.",

We had the Buffalo Cauliflower (and they had a vegan Ranch sauce option), I ordered the Vegan Supreme with arugula and a Watermelon Italian Soda. My husband ordered an Orange Creamsicle Italian Soda, the Great Alfredo pizza and Nutella Beignets for dessert. Warm, friendly, and prompt service.\n\nWe recommend eating here: delicious food, great services, views of the mountains, a cute spot in the downtown area, perfect for a post meal walk.",

          "text": "Let me start by saying this: if NASA ever decides to shoot a pizza into space as a symbol of human achievement, it should come from Fat Daddy‚Äôs Pizza. Not just because it‚Äôs good‚Äîbut because it transcends the very concept of food. I walked in craving a slice. I walked out with a new religion, a new pant size, and what I can only describe as a spiritual yeast infection.\n\nThis place isn‚Äôt a restaurant. It‚Äôs a portal. A gateway to a greasy, cheesy dimension where self-control goes to die and mozzarella flows like wine. I don‚Äôt know what kind of dark sorcery they use in that kitchen, but I‚Äôm convinced the oven is powered by the tears of gym trainers.\n\nThe First Bite:\nMy first bite of Fat Daddy‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeat Monster‚Äù pizza was like being slapped in the face by a delicious pork ghost. I blacked out briefly and woke up 15 minutes later, shirtless, covered in pepperoni sweat, whispering ‚Äúmore‚Äù like Gollum. You think I‚Äôm exaggerating? My Apple Watch called 911. It thought I was being attacked.\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nThe ambiance is somewhere between ‚Äúcollege town fever dream‚Äù and ‚Äú1970s basement rec room with a gambling problem.‚Äù Neon lights. Wobbly tables. A signed photo of someone who looks kind of like Guy Fieri but might just be the owner‚Äôs cousin in a bowling shirt. And yet‚Äîit works. Every surface feels like it‚Äôs been lovingly wiped down with pizza grease and broken dreams.\n\nThe Staff:\nThe staff at Fat Daddy‚Äôs are a mix of chaos and comfort. One guy yelled ‚ÄúLIVE MAS‚Äù when I walked in, then remembered that‚Äôs Taco Bell and whispered an apology to a pizza. Another employee brought out a garlic knot the size of a newborn child and said, ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs on the house. He chose you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt question it.\n\nThe Pizza:\nOh, the pizza. It‚Äôs not just pizza. It‚Äôs a commitment. A personal challenge. A test of your emotional boundaries. The slices are so big you legally need a forklift license to lift two at once. The crust is crisp yet doughy, like the perfect mix of a French baguette and a pool floatie. The cheese? Elastic enough to double as a bungee cord in emergencies.\n\nI tried the ‚ÄúCheeseburger Bacon Ranch BBQ Double Stuffed Jalape√±o Surprise,‚Äù and let me tell you‚Äîthere were no survivors. I wept. A single jalape√±o seed whispered its way into my soul and reawakened trauma from the 5th grade. I both hated and respected it.\n\nThe Aftermath:\nI left Fat Daddy‚Äôs a changed man. My pants no longer fit. My car leaned slightly to the left when I got in. I took a nap in the parking lot and woke up three hours later with a cheese blister and a tattoo of a cartoon sausage that I definitely didn‚Äôt have before.\n\nI gained twelve pounds. In one night. My FitBit is sending me passive-aggressive notifications like ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you want to talk?‚Äù\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nFat Daddy‚Äôs Pizza is not just a place‚Äîit‚Äôs an event. A pilgrimage. A test of how far you‚Äôre willing to go in pursuit of joy. If you value your health, your dignity, or your belt loops, stay away. But if you‚Äôre ready to embrace the chaos, to give yourself fully to the cult of cheese and the gospel of grease‚Ä¶ welcome home.\n\n10/10. Would ruin my life again",

            "text": "Okay , went here for lunch with my girlfriend . Everything was alright . Got our drinks and then we put in our order . My girlfriend got the wings and fries and I got a pizza. 10 minutes later the wings and fries come out which I was like okay kind of weird to only bring one persons food out but okay. Then this is where things got frustrating . The server did not come and check in on us . My girlfriend wanted ketchup for her fries and it took 10 minutes for him to come back. Keep in mind there are 2 other tables in the restaurant. Now this is the part that really frustrates me. It took 30 minutes for a medium pizza. There was 2 other tables there and they both had their food already. So that means the cooks either just didn‚Äôt make the order because they were lazy or they weren‚Äôt paying attention. I worked in the restaurant industry for 6 years and never once have known anywhere to bake a pizza for more than 15 minutes. The server barely even offered condolences about the time it took. I just don‚Äôt understand how this can be acceptable",
