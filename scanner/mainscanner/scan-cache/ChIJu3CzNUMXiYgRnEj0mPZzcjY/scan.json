A matchmade in heaven, although strikingly similar to Raising Cane's, this is Alabama's version.\n\nService: Nothing too special or too bad, just your regular staff member at the counter, she was nice and all, you know me, I don't like to take pictures of the staff members because they might not like it due to privacy concerns.\n\nAtmosphere: Simple and sweet, something you would see out of a restaurant for sure, bright interior with the lights, checked out the bathroom, clean and not dirty. Someone has definitely been cleaning up around here or maybe not a lot of people have been coming inside.\n\nFood: Again, it's not much to work with, you get 4 things in a box. Fries! Chicken Tenders! Cole Slaw! and to top it off, some toast bread that seems very fluffy to eat. Chicken is rich and crunchy, almost like you're meant to use it with the sauce, it's exactly like Cane's but I'd have to settle a debate and buy both one day and find out for myself. Fries are like a bigger and better version of your typical crinkle fries, just enough seasoning. Cole Slaw might not be for everyone but you can always try it out for funzies.\n\nOh and they have a drive thru as well ü§£üëç",

          "text": "I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received at the Guthrie's location at 4629 US 280, Birmingham, AL. During my recent visit to Birmingham for work, I was excited to see a Guthrie's, as it brought back nostalgic memories from my college days in Tallahassee back in 1999.\n\nHowever, my experience was far from pleasant. On June 27, 2024, I arrived at the Guthrie's location at approximately 9:42 PM, well before the posted closing time of 10:00 PM. My spouse was in the car waiting for food from Whataburger across the street, so I decided to walk over to Guthrie's to place an order.\n\nTo my surprise, the main lobby was already locked. When I explained to the manager that I wanted to place an order, she instructed me to go through the drive-thru. I reiterated that my girlfriend had the vehicle and we would not make it through the drive-thru before closing time. Despite my explanation, the manager continued to insist that I use the drive-thru.\n\nFrustrated, I went to the drive-thru window on foot. I felt disrespected and unheard, especially when the manager assumed I was a delivery driver for GrubHub or Uber Eats despite my repeated explanations. This experience has left a sour taste in my mouth, overshadowing the fond memories I had of Guthrie's from my college days.\n\nI hope you understand the disappointment this has caused and take steps to ensure that other customers do not face similar issues in the future. Based on this experience, I no longer see Guthrie's as the nostalgic and enjoyable place I once knew.",

Myself as well as CO workers of mine that work on the same strip as this eatery spend well over enough for better service or at least a correct order. The female working the window was blatantly RUDE about the online order that was placed, pushed us down from the window stating there was no order placed (when there was) did not ask if ketchup was needed for the online order (attitude given entire time) once the order was brought out to the car, ketchup was then asked for and the associate informed that we CAN come inside and get it..\n\nSo thinking maybe they are busy on the inside we proceeded to go in to get the ketchup seeing that there are four to five associates currently working that should have been more than happy to help if she was not (wish I had her name). Once we received our food and saw the errors that were made we call the store spoke with the manager Brandy and however she was trying to explain there were and however she was trying to explain there were loopholes within her excuses which made it VERY DIFFICULT to communicate with her over the phone. Spending Half of $100 Dollars, THERE WERE NO RESOLUTIONS MADE ON TODAY JUNE 12TH 2024 FROM THAT MANAGER. As of now WE WILL NOT BE NEEDING THESES SERVICES OR HEADACHES. Unless people are there to work efficiently!",

          "text": "We eat at Guthrie's any chance we get! Had an appt in B'ham so took advantage and ate at the Guthrie's on Hwy 280.  It's always good - but it was perfect this day.  Nothing could have made it any better.  The chicken  was tender and juicy on the inside with a perfect thin crispy coating on the outside!  Same for the fries - and seasoned perfectly!  The toasted bread as well - not too brown, but a little 'crunch' to the bite! The slaw was delicious as always.  The entire meal was excellent. Please pass this on to your 'crew.'  Oh, I had eaten at a burger chain a few days earlier and spent just about the same and there was NO COMPARISON!  This place does NOT even have a warmer.  Your food is always going to be FRESH and reasonably priced!",

          "text": "Ever loved chicken? Is it part of your main diet? You feel like you want to eat chicken for the rest of your life, well here it is. Guthrie's. A matchmade in heaven, although strikingly similar to Raising Cane's, this is Alabama's version.\n\nService: Nothing too special or too bad, just your regular staff member at the counter, she was nice and all, you know me, I don't like to take pictures of the staff members because they might not like it due to privacy concerns.\n\nAtmosphere: Simple and sweet, something you would see out of a restaurant for sure, bright interior with the lights, checked out the bathroom, clean and not dirty. Someone has definitely been cleaning up around here or maybe not a lot of people have been coming inside.\n\nFood: Again, it's not much to work with, you get 4 things in a box. Fries! Chicken Tenders! Cole Slaw! and to top it off, some toast bread that seems very fluffy to eat. Chicken is rich and crunchy, almost like you're meant to use it with the sauce, it's exactly like Cane's but I'd have to settle a debate and buy both one day and find out for myself. Fries are like a bigger and better version of your typical crinkle fries, just enough seasoning. Cole Slaw might not be for everyone but you can always try it out for funzies.\n\nOh and they have a drive thru as well ü§£üëç",
