          "text": "OxVegas chicken is Oxfords newest chicken spot. To start out with the negatives, this place is always incredibly dirty when it‚Äôs busy. They do not have workers wiping down tables and they let the filth build on the tables. The prices are typical for a chicken meal similar to canes but the size of tenders they give you can be unacceptable (small or lacking meat). Their tender sizes needs to be more consistent. I would cut them some slack if they weren‚Äôt so stingy about giving an extra sauce but they WILL NOT give u an extra ranch or any sauce if you ask. Customer service is everything and if you can‚Äôt perform in food quality maybe shine with your costumer service. Their pretzel bread is unique and the fries are not my favorite but always come super fresh. The OxVegas sauce is really good as well. Would rather drive 25 minutes to Canes.",

Shortly after that, I came to try it out, but was told they ran out of chicken.  A few months later, I finally got to try it out, They had a kiosk order system, however, after I had made out my order on there it asked me if I wanted to pay by card, there is no option for cash on the kiosk. There was a note to see an employee if you were paying cash, I thought that would get my order committed after having placed it in the kiosk. We had to go over to the bar to place the order, girl behind the bar was very nice, but there was a swarm of gnats going on. Got the \"junior\" meal, It was out very quickly. There was a hamburger bun top with garlic butter on it.  That seemed a little weird, this would be much better with Texas toast.  The 'kickin' sauce was just a Tabasco, the barbecue seemed out of a bottle.  The chicken by itself was good. The windows were desperately in need of a clean, I would highly recommend they get a professional window cleaner. Almost impossible to enjoy the meal because of the flies. If the owners read this review, hire professional window cleaners.  Take some aggressive action to mitigate the flying insects.  Fix your point of sale to accept cash on pickup, so you don't waste people's time.  Keep your tables clean. Was very impressed when the girl who took our order asked for my review.",

Charging $2.49 for an 8oz cup, the chicken is the size of chicken nuggets at McDonald's (and worse taste), and charging extra for more than one sauce. This whole place just screamed cheap and low quality but then charged you as if it was a nice restaurant.",

Very tender (no pun intended...) and juicy, with a nice, crisp breading. Like the option of having a beer or cocktail with my tenders too!  I'd prefer my Texas toast to be toasted on both sides, but other places do it this way too, so...  Looking forward to trying more homemade sauce flavors as they're getting their feet wet and start to make their own way. Highly recommended!!",

Super flavorful! The fries had great flavoring also. Just wish they were a tad bit more crisp. The oxvegas sauce was sweet and zesty. Not too goopy but also not overly thin. My only complaint about the food is the bread. It‚Äôs just a toasted piece of bread. No flavor. I wish it had a garlic flavor. Super fast!

They do not have workers wiping down tables and they let the filth build on the tables. The prices are typical for a chicken meal similar to canes but the size of tenders they give you can be unacceptable (small or lacking meat). Their tender sizes needs to be more consistent. I would cut them some slack if they weren‚Äôt so stingy about giving an extra sauce but they WILL NOT give u an extra ranch or any sauce if you ask. Customer service is everything and if you can‚Äôt perform in food quality maybe shine with your costumer service. Their pretzel bread is unique and the fries are not my favorite but always come super fresh. The OxVegas sauce is really good as well. Would rather drive 25 minutes to Canes.",
