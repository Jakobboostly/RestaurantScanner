The wings were cooked well but absolutely no where near enough sauce. I should not have to pay extra money to get enough sauce for wings. They do a VERY light glaze of the wings with the sauce and that's it unless you pay nearly 3$ extra. Which I find crazy honestly. The pizza was good and like I mentioned, the wings were good...but...no where near enough sauce at all. I'd come back but I guess I'd be forced to pay for extra sauce.",

These were excessively greasy, to the point we we sopping up grease w paper towels. The bottoms were so hard, they couldn't even be cut. One was basically burned. I took 1 bite & spit it out.

The wings were cooked well but absolutely no where near enough sauce. I should not have to pay extra money to get enough sauce for wings. They do a VERY light glaze of the wings with the sauce and that's it unless you pay nearly 3$ extra. Which I find crazy honestly. The pizza was good and like I mentioned, the wings were good...but...no where near enough sauce at all. I'd come back but I guess I'd be forced to pay for extra sauce.",

These were excessively greasy, to the point we we sopping up grease w paper towels. The bottoms were so hard, they couldn't even be cut. One was basically burned. I took 1 bite & spit it out. All you could taste was grease. Totally disgusting.  I will NEVER be back & i HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT EATING HERE!\n2 trips in 1. First & last. ü§Æ",

That was the case UNTIL, the other day, we noticed in our lunch special 2 slices and a drink, that THINGS CHANGED! It is no longer NY style. You can tell they are trying to save money on how much they put into the lunch special. (cut a little here and there....not the same pizza)",

If you order extra sauce they charge you $4.99 extra.  Hasn't anyone ever told you that the sauce cost hardly anything...maybe an extra .25 cents. At least charge the amount of an extra topping.  Why give so much cheese? If I wanted extra cheese I would order it. I have tried this restaurant several times after the new owners and have been disappointed every time. I miss the old restaurant!",

The wings were cooked well but absolutely no where near enough sauce. I should not have to pay extra money to get enough sauce for wings. They do a VERY light glaze of the wings with the sauce and that's it unless you pay nearly 3$ extra. Which I find crazy honestly. The pizza was good and like I mentioned, the wings were good...but...no where near enough sauce at all. I'd come back but I guess I'd be forced to pay for extra sauce.",

These were excessively greasy, to the point we we sopping up grease w paper towels. The bottoms were so hard, they couldn't even be cut. One was basically burned. I took 1 bite & spit it out. All you could taste was grease. Totally disgusting.  I will NEVER be back & i HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT EATING HERE!\n2 trips in 1. First & last. ü§Æ",

When it was sold, we were sad.  But we were hopeful they'd keep the same recipes for the food. That was the case UNTIL, the other day, we noticed in our lunch special 2 slices and a drink, that THINGS CHANGED! It is no longer NY style. You can tell they are trying to save money on how much they put into the lunch special. (cut a little here and there....not the same pizza)",

If you order extra sauce they charge you $4.99 extra.  Hasn't anyone ever told you that the sauce cost hardly anything...maybe an extra .25 cents. At least charge the amount of an extra topping.  Why give so much cheese? If I wanted extra cheese I would order it. I have tried this restaurant several times after the new owners and have been disappointed every time. I miss the old restaurant!",
