We‚Äôve been driving to Paradise Valley thinking that was the main one, but no more. This is the real deal.\n\nMonica took amazing care of us‚Äîprofessional, warm, and attentive. Hank kept our glasses full with still and sparkling water, always perfectly timed. Just top-tier service all around.\n\nWe ordered the Tomahawk Chop Australian Wagyu and the 8 oz A5 New York Strip‚Äîboth phenomenal cuts, perfectly cooked, rich, and tender. For sides, we went big: garlic mashed potatoes, white cheddar mac and cheese, broccolini, and creamed spinach. The portions were massive‚Äîdefinitely sharing size, and absolutely delicious.\n\nThe B√©arnaise sauce deserves a moment of its own‚Äîrich, velvety, and the perfect complement to the steaks. Don‚Äôt skip it.\n\nA huge thank you as well to the team member who boxed up our food‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt catch your name, but you packed everything with care. Breakfast tomorrow is going to be legit.\n\nMike, the GM, came by to check in after our meal‚Äîgreat conversation and a genuine touch that capped off the night perfectly.\n\nThe vibe here is different from the newer Mastro‚Äôs locations‚Äîmore grounded, more generous. Great value, outstanding service, and an experience that truly stands out.\n\nWe made sure to show our appreciation at the end‚Äîgreat service like this deserves to be recognized. We‚Äôll definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in Scottsdale. Thanks again to the whole team.",

Food was excellent, and timing for each part of the meal was perfect. The wine selection is extensive, I settle on a dry cabernet. We had reservations so no waiting. Most of the close parking is valet service. We found an open spot close by. We had a nice evening dining out. We spent $350.00 on dinner including a generous tip for the service. We dressed casual but appropriately for the evening. Jacket and tie not required. We went to the restaurant in Scottsdale. The drive/directions/traffic was normal for a 6pm dinner reservation. Plan ahead, drive safe, make reservation to ensure you are seated as the tables filled up as the evening hours approached. Lastly, good place to take that special person in your life and enjoy the moment. Everything  else, FORGET ABOUT IT.",

We‚Äôve been driving to Paradise Valley thinking that was the main one, but no more. This is the real deal.\n\nMonica took amazing care of us‚Äîprofessional, warm, and attentive. Hank kept our glasses full with still and sparkling water, always perfectly timed. Just top-tier service all around.\n\nWe ordered the Tomahawk Chop Australian Wagyu and the 8 oz A5 New York Strip‚Äîboth phenomenal cuts, perfectly cooked, rich, and tender. For sides, we went big: garlic mashed potatoes, white cheddar mac and cheese, broccolini, and creamed spinach. The portions were massive‚Äîdefinitely sharing size, and absolutely delicious.\n\nThe B√©arnaise sauce deserves a moment of its own‚Äîrich, velvety, and the perfect complement to the steaks. Don‚Äôt skip it.\n\nA huge thank you as well to the team member who boxed up our food‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt catch your name, but you packed everything with care. Breakfast tomorrow is going to be legit.\n\nMike, the GM, came by to check in after our meal‚Äîgreat conversation and a genuine touch that capped off the night perfectly.\n\nThe vibe here is different from the newer Mastro‚Äôs locations‚Äîmore grounded, more generous. Great value, outstanding service, and an experience that truly stands out.\n\nWe made sure to show our appreciation at the end‚Äîgreat service like this deserves to be recognized. We‚Äôll definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in Scottsdale. Thanks again to the whole team.",

The manager (Bernice) is phenomenal and is extremely helpful when we use their private rooms for events. The staff at Mastro‚Äôs is all about the details and they don‚Äôt miss a beat. This place checks off all the boxes.",

The bartender popped a bottle of champagne in our direction and the cork shot at my glass, small shards went everywhere, my dress and phone were covered in champagne, and my partners pants were soaked and sticky. The managers solution? A round of drinks.\nAs someone who frequents Mastro's and has even reserved private rooms for family events this was such an embarrassing and unsatisfactory experience. Both my partner and I were so disappointed with the resolution from the manager. Someone could have gotten seriously injured had one of the glass shards cut someone.",

The kind of service that you absolutely do not see or receive anymore. There are only two reasons to leave a review, either 5 stars for excellence or 1 star for failure, I only wish there was a 10 star system, that is exactly where Mastro‚Äôs would sit every time. You absolutely must try the prawn appetizer, yum! And can we talk about the lobsters tails? I had stopped ordering lobster at restaurants because they consistently were not cooked well at all. That ended last night when I had the best lobster tail ever! And if you are lucky enough to dine here, make room for dessert! My personal favorites, the cheesecake and the butter cake. So delicious and HUGE serving sizes. I promise that ‚Äúto go‚Äù boxes will be in your future.",

The only real issues I have are that when I go to an upscale restaurant like this, I am not bothered to spend $400 for dinner for two, but I expect a bit better experience and ambiance.  The tables are so crowded in together that it feels almost like you are sitting with the people at the  next tables.  Also, when I reserve a table for two, I expect to be sitting across from my date, and not side-by-side or even  around the corner of the table.  Make the experience match the price please.",

I came in Christmas Day with 2 friends. As soon as we came in we were not greeted with smiles but blank stares. As we are being seated she DEMANDS me, does not ASK me, to take off my hat. Why tell me as you are sitting me? why not advise me at the lobby before walking into the dining room? Instead Paulie wanted to do it in front of everyone then give me attitude with it. Anyways I asked her why, instead of simply replying to me ‚Äúit‚Äôs against dress code‚Äù she quickly escalates the situation by saying to me rudely ‚Äúdo you want me to get a manager‚Äù I answered yes. After being seated it took about 20 min just to get menus. Shortly after Mike the manager comes in says ‚Äúyou can not wear hats in MY dining room‚Äù. My hat is already off and has been off and I didn‚Äôt realize this establishment is called ‚Äúmikes steakhouse‚Äù but okay. He then talks to me like I never been to steakhouse before which I felt he was stereotyping. Anyways for the inconvenience he gifted us free appetizers and a round of drinks which is highly appreciated but come on Mike.  Get off your high horse and talk to your guest like humans. I understand Mike came in to defend his colleague but before you do that at least see both sides don‚Äôt jump to conclusion. Anyways this is why steak 44 will always be #1. Thank you to our server Austin for picking up there slack. He was super cool.",

            "text": "As always, the dinner was great.  Service was very good, and the table assistants (water boy, bread  and bussers) were great.  The only real issues I have are that when I go to an upscale restaurant like this, I am not bothered to spend $400 for dinner for two, but I expect a bit better experience and ambiance.  The tables are so crowded in together that it feels almost like you are sitting with the people at the  next tables.  Also, when I reserve a table for two, I expect to be sitting across from my date, and not side-by-side or even  around the corner of the table.  Make the experience match the price please.",

A homemade turkey sandwich would be better than the steak I received.  $31 for a serving of 4 shrimp , steak taste like it was soaking in oil but dry at the same time no flavor and Hot popping grease flying on your arms your clothes when served . Carpet smelled foul where seated . It's a NO",

The bartender popped a bottle of champagne in our direction and the cork shot at my glass, small shards went everywhere, my dress and phone were covered in champagne, and my partners pants were soaked and sticky. The managers solution? A round of drinks.\nAs someone who frequents Mastro's and has even reserved private rooms for family events this was such an embarrassing and unsatisfactory experience. Both my partner and I were so disappointed with the resolution from the manager. Someone could have gotten seriously injured had one of the glass shards cut someone.",

I‚Äôve had better service at McDonald‚Äôs.  üòÇ but seriously rude Maitre D, rude hostess, poor table service and even the valet abandoned his post early and brought our keys to our table before we even finished dinner! I mean have you ever heard of that? The food quality was terrible! Do not attend this location of Mastro‚Äôs! The entire staff should be fired and start over again. That‚Äôs the only solution. We‚Äôve been to all the mastros over the valley. This location was terrible.",
