We‚Äôre visiting from Utah for spring break, and I haven‚Äôt been in Denver for 25 years, so this was a bucket list stop. I worked for Tony from 1995-1997 while I was going to culinary school. In those days he had an amazing bakery called Campana and the best Italian restaurant on Broadway. I was lucky, and got to work at both! People would wait for hours, even when it was freezing outside. Tony Pasquini knows how to pull a crowd. I loved the people I worked with, the atmosphere, and I especially loved the food. Tony‚Äôs artisan breads will always hold a place in my heart. They took me all over the city because I sampled them for the bakery at Alfalfa‚Äôs and Wild Oats. I sold a lot of bread. ‚ô•Ô∏è\nMy memories of the pizza, breadsticks, marinara, and salads were spot on. The sauce, made with San Marzano tomatoes, is outstanding. I enjoyed every bite. We missed Tony but had the pleasure of meeting and being served by the manager. He took good care of us, answered all of my questions, and was kind when the nostalgia of everything brought some tears to my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt help it!\nTony, I think fondly of how well we were taken care of under your leadership. You and Judy made us feel like we were part of your family. Best wishes to you and Judy. I‚Äôm a forever fan and I‚Äôm so grateful I could share this experience with my family.\nIf you made it this far, take my advice and enjoy a meal at Tony P‚Äôs. I highly recommend regular visits! ‚ô•Ô∏è",

          "text": "We stopped for lunch at Tony P‚Äôs yesterday and had a wonderful experience. We‚Äôre visiting from Utah for spring break, and I haven‚Äôt been in Denver for 25 years, so this was a bucket list stop. I worked for Tony from 1995-1997 while I was going to culinary school. In those days he had an amazing bakery called Campana and the best Italian restaurant on Broadway. I was lucky, and got to work at both! People would wait for hours, even when it was freezing outside. Tony Pasquini knows how to pull a crowd. I loved the people I worked with, the atmosphere, and I especially loved the food. Tony‚Äôs artisan breads will always hold a place in my heart. They took me all over the city because I sampled them for the bakery at Alfalfa‚Äôs and Wild Oats. I sold a lot of bread. ‚ô•Ô∏è\nMy memories of the pizza, breadsticks, marinara, and salads were spot on. The sauce, made with San Marzano tomatoes, is outstanding. I enjoyed every bite. We missed Tony but had the pleasure of meeting and being served by the manager. He took good care of us, answered all of my questions, and was kind when the nostalgia of everything brought some tears to my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt help it!\nTony, I think fondly of how well we were taken care of under your leadership. You and Judy made us feel like we were part of your family. Best wishes to you and Judy. I‚Äôm a forever fan and I‚Äôm so grateful I could share this experience with my family.\nIf you made it this far, take my advice and enjoy a meal at Tony P‚Äôs. I highly recommend regular visits! ‚ô•Ô∏è",
