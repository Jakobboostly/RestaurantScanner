I ordered a cheese pizza for my kids (which they loved!). Super cheesy and delicious.\nMy husband and I shared a square Corktown Groove and it was delicious! Nice big rectangular pieces. Full of toppings. The crust was nice and crispy with an abundance of toast cheesy bits. The pickles, spinach, feta, bacon and a drizzle of honey may sound like an odd combo but it was amazing! The flavours worked so well together!",

The ingredients are fresh which make the flavours mesh really well together. The real test is the next day reheat,, and it was just as good !!!

We went for their signature square pie, \"The Good Pie,\" and it was absolutely incredible.\n\nThe melted cheese caramelized right to the edge, forming this thick, crispy, cheesy crust‚Äîpure heaven. The sauce layered over the cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and jalape√±os created an explosion of flavor in every bite. I was a bit worried the crust would be too thick, but the balance between the toppings and crust was absolutely spot-on.\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu!",

Yes it is delicious, the flavours all compliment eachother very well the hot honey isn‚Äôt very spicy just a hint of spice ,but it‚Äôs good. The crust has a good crisp too it , and the pizza sauce is definitely unique to others pizza places but I really enjoy it . I‚Äôll definitely come back , only thing I noticed is the slices of jalape√±o are a bit thick slightly thinner would be nice. Overall 4.6/5 pizza !!",

I didn't order ahead of time, so had to wait for my order for about 20 mins.  The gentleman that was making the pizza was generous to offer me a free slice while I was waiting.  They have regular round pies and Detroit style squares.  I ordered one of each to try and was satisfied on both of them.  The Detroit style 4 slice square is larger then it sounds and the pizza is light and fluffy.  Good to have another pizza shop I can try that is also close to my house.",

Downside (at night fault of Red Top), took about 45 minutes from their door to mine. When the driver dropped it off on my entrance...he literally dropped it. Also, no thermal bag so no idea if he used the bag during transport. Also, something wet was on top of the box. Again, Red Top had absolutely no control over this. Upon arrival, the Pizza was cold (figured it would be), so I re heated it in the oven. It's was pretty tasty. Nice flavor, and the crust was great. Detroit style Pizza is a nice treat/change from time to time. I certainly plan on ordering again. Any chance you guys opening a second location near DT? Yep, I know, I'm kind of selfish. I live DT and don't have a car.",

I've never had it before so I can't say how authentic it was, but the pizzas I ordered tasted great and were well dressed for the most part. We had ordered their special \"Pesto Pie\" and \"The Good Pie\". The pesto pie was our favourite with the unique flavour it had. The good pie and its hot honey drizzle was still tasty with a nice kick too. We picked up and the service was very quick. The location is among a bunch of condo construction so may be easy to miss. Overall a positive first experience with Detroit style pizza!",

          "text": "Love this place. Wanted to try something other than the usual spots I go to, and gave Red Top a shot. This place did not disappoint! The pizzas taste very fresh. The quality of the ingredients is very evident. It's Detroit-style, so the cuts are bigger and thicker; almost pie-like. Just something to keep in mind. They are mostly Halal with the exception of a few options, so definitely a plus for Halal-conscious consumers. The pricing is above market average, but they do have BOGO deals often enough, and I found it to be worth it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and will most definitely be coming back myself!",

Yes it is delicious, the flavours all compliment eachother very well the hot honey isn‚Äôt very spicy just a hint of spice ,but it‚Äôs good. The crust has a good crisp too it , and the pizza sauce is definitely unique to others pizza places but I really enjoy it . I‚Äôll definitely come back , only thing I noticed is the slices of jalape√±o are a bit thick slightly thinner would be nice. Overall 4.6/5 pizza !!",

Thank you for your help!\n\nOrdered two Detroit style pizzas for delivery through Skip. The pizza's had minimal toppings and you almost could not even find the cheese.

We went for their signature square pie, \"The Good Pie,\" and it was absolutely incredible.\n\nThe melted cheese caramelized right to the edge, forming this thick, crispy, cheesy crust‚Äîpure heaven. The sauce layered over the cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and jalape√±os created an explosion of flavor in every bite. I was a bit worried the crust would be too thick, but the balance between the toppings and crust was absolutely spot-on.\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu!",

          "text": "First time ever trying Red Top Pizza and I am soo glad I did!!! I wasn‚Äôt able to eat dinner tonight and at around 12:15 am came across this pizza place on skip. Decided to check the reviews and even though most were great I was hesitant. Had a lot of bad experiences with ordering on skip late hours. Usually felt like most servers don‚Äôt care after a certain time. I called in to make sure it was halal as well as time of delivery stop. I literally had 10 min to order. The person on the phone was super friendly so I felt a lot more comfortable to order. I got the 10‚Äù Detroiter and it was delicious!!! Honestly 1 of the best pizza‚Äôs I‚Äôve had for years! And for them to make it right before closing was top notch! I‚Äôm from states and felt like the pizza (as well as other food spots) was lacking here. But y‚Äôall did the damnnn thannnng! Keep it up!",

          "text": "December 4th Update:\n\nNow I've lost interest in this place. I ordered two 8 square Detroit styles for myself and three friends visiting last night. This was their first time trying a Detroit style which I raved about. But this place is refusing to address an issue that many people have complained about in their reviews. And that is the skimpy amount of toppings.\n\nThe consistency here is poor. I spoke to the owner once about this and he apologized, offered me a free pizza and made things right. But......... then the consistency does not remain.\n\nI'm pissed off now. This was their chance to get three new customers, but they failed. The Zeus had plenty of chicken but only paper thin slices of ham which we could not taste. The Arabian (Donair) was worse. One paper thin slice of donair meat which again, you couldn't even taste. So cheap with the toppings. I might as well buy a \"Hot and Ready\" pizza from Little Caesars. There's not much toppings on it either, but at least it doesn't cost $32!\n\nObviously they cannot get this problem under control and will now continue to lose customers. I've read though the reviews and many others have complained about this. Eventually this will hurt the business. Very sad that at times they nail this pizza, and other times it's just so disappointing.\n\nPic shows different angles of my pizza as I took bites. You'll see a little sliver of a donair and me peeking through the center in one pic. Grab a magnifying glass so you can see it.\n\nCompare to my last review below. This is how inconsistency can change someone's view.\n\nLast Review:\n\nThe owner knows what he's doing, and travels to other cities and countries to experience their pizzas. In my opinion he's a pizza expert!. He is passionate about pizza, and makes an AMAZING Detroit style. I grew up close to Detroit (Ontario side) and know that what he is doing here in Calgary is legitimate. Don't listen to the other reviewers complaining about the crust thickness, cheese, toppings, etc because they have no clue what they are talking about. I doubt they've even had a Detroit Style from the source in Detroit or Michigan before, but yet here they are flapping their gums and complaining. If you've never had one before then you are in for a treat. Understand that the crust is different from other pizzas, it's caramelized around the edges (delicious), uses brick cheese, and finishes off with the sauce on the top. The only pizza it should be compared to is another Detroit Style Pizza. Order one with an open mind, and you'll be hooked. Absolutely Delicious!! I LOVE this place.",

Our pizzas are usually pretty damn good, but tonight's pizzas tasted exceptionally better, so whatever they're doing they're doing it right!\n\nNote to everyone, the proper way to get pizzas here is with a big party so you can try all the different ones at once!  (My personal favs are the Detroiter and the Pesto, but they're all really good.)",
