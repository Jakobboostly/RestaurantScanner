They texted me at 25% off coupon which saved me around $6 and when I arrived to pick up the food it was just coming out right on time hot and delicious. I got the jalapeno poppers which I love and also the Philly cheese steak egg rolls which are amazing.\n\nThis was the first time I tried the online ordering because we usually always go in and sit down at the bar to eat, I was very pleased with the ease of pickup. We love going to Hurricane's Grill because of the awesome happy hour 7:00 to 9:00 drink specials and there's usually always a food special any given day of the week. Saturday is my absolute favorite half-price off ribs all day and the ribs are unbelievable.\nWhenever I come down from Boston to visit my parents in Lancaster, this is one of our favorite places and where we usually always end up when we want some delicious affordable food & drinks out...",

I so wanted this food to be excellent.  Ehhh‚Ä¶ Mozzarella Sticks are frozen & didn‚Äôt have any flavor.  If you are going to keep serving these toss them in a salt, Italian seasoning mix before serving.  It will make a world of difference.  Marinara sauce was ok, nothing distinctive.  Cheeseburger Sub was very light, no real flavor & not worth the price of admission.  Salt, pepper, heavy oregano would be a good start.  I will give this place another try in the future for the simple fact they seem to genuinely care based on my interaction.  We shall see!!!",

          "text": "One of the worst experiences at a restaurant that I've ever had and NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM on their website! In this day and age what business doesn't have a way to contact them (or the owner) if there's a problem.\nI've worked in restaurants for the last 40 years and have never encountered anything like this.\nWe went in at 4pm on a Wed. Ordered mozz sticks, a cheesesteak and some of the crab fries. After 30 min I asked about the mozz sticks and was told they were very busy (only 1 other table and 4 other workers playing on their phones in the kitchen) and would be out shortly. After 45 min they came out, lukewarm at best so they were hard. After another 10 min our cheesesteak and crab fries came. Cheesesteak had no sauce (though it was listed on the menu) and the crab fries were cold enough the cheese on top was hard (like the mozz sticks). Server never came back and I had to go to her about it. She didn't seem to care so I asked for a manager. I was told there wasn't a manager or anyone in charge to talk to. Again- what!? I talked to the young girl at the counter who was doing carry out and explained the problem.  She took off the mozz sticks and then had the server hand us the check.  I told the server I wasn't happy and we didn't even touch the crab fries because they were inedible. Again she just didn't seem to care. I went back to the counter again and explained again that everything was cold and weren't going to eat.  At this point she took off the crab fries but added the mozz sticks back on.\nI ended up paying for the cheesesteak (which we did eat half of since we were so hungry) and the mozz sticks and left.\nI usually give a place a second chance because everyone has a bad day when everything goes wrong but this was bad food, bad service and to top it off there was no way to tell anyone connected to the business what a bad experience it was.\nUnbelievable!\nI def won't be going back right away, if ever. Maybe I'll wait 6 months to see if anything changes.",

          "text": "One of the worst experiences at a restaurant that I've ever had and NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM on their website! In this day and age what business doesn't have a way to contact them (or the owner) if there's a problem.\nI've worked in restaurants for the last 40 years and have never encountered anything like this.\nWe went in at 4pm on a Wed. Ordered mozz sticks, a cheesesteak and some of the crab fries. After 30 min I asked about the mozz sticks and was told they were very busy (only 1 other table and 4 other workers playing on their phones in the kitchen) and would be out shortly. After 45 min they came out, lukewarm at best so they were hard. After another 10 min our cheesesteak and crab fries came. Cheesesteak had no sauce (though it was listed on the menu) and the crab fries were cold enough the cheese on top was hard (like the mozz sticks). Server never came back and I had to go to her about it. She didn't seem to care so I asked for a manager. I was told there wasn't a manager or anyone in charge to talk to. Again- what!? I talked to the young girl at the counter who was doing carry out and explained the problem.  She took off the mozz sticks and then had the server hand us the check.  I told the server I wasn't happy and we didn't even touch the crab fries because they were inedible. Again she just didn't seem to care. I went back to the counter again and explained again that everything was cold and weren't going to eat.  At this point she took off the crab fries but added the mozz sticks back on.\nI ended up paying for the cheesesteak (which we did eat half of since we were so hungry) and the mozz sticks and left.\nI usually give a place a second chance because everyone has a bad day when everything goes wrong but this was bad food, bad service and to top it off there was no way to tell anyone connected to the business what a bad experience it was.\nUnbelievable!\nI def won't be going back right away, if ever. Maybe I'll wait 6 months to see if anything changes.",

If you are going to keep serving these toss them in a salt, Italian seasoning mix before serving.  It will make a world of difference.  Marinara sauce was ok, nothing distinctive.

In this day and age what business doesn't have a way to contact them (or the owner) if there's a problem.\nI've worked in restaurants for the last 40 years and have never encountered anything like this.\nWe went in at 4pm on a Wed. Ordered mozz sticks, a cheesesteak and some of the crab fries. After 30 min I asked about the mozz sticks and was told they were very busy (only 1 other table and 4 other workers playing on their phones in the kitchen) and would be out shortly. After 45 min they came out, lukewarm at best so they were hard. After another 10 min our cheesesteak and crab fries came. Cheesesteak had no sauce (though it was listed on the menu) and the crab fries were cold enough the cheese on top was hard (like the mozz sticks). Server never came back and I had to go to her about it. She didn't seem to care so I asked for a manager. I was told there wasn't a manager or anyone in charge to talk to. Again- what!? I talked to the young girl at the counter who was doing carry out and explained the problem.  She took off the mozz sticks and then had the server hand us the check.  I told the server I wasn't happy and we didn't even touch the crab fries because they were inedible. Again she just didn't seem to care. I went back to the counter again and explained again that everything was cold and weren't going to eat.  At this point she took off the crab fries but added the mozz sticks back on.\nI ended up paying for the cheesesteak (which we did eat half of since we were so hungry) and the mozz sticks and left.\nI usually give a place a second chance because everyone has a bad day when everything goes wrong but this was bad food, bad service and to top it off there was no way to tell anyone connected to the business what a bad experience it was.\nUnbelievable!\nI def won't be going back right away, if ever. Maybe I'll wait 6 months to see if anything changes.",

            "text": "First, this was an extremely easy interaction.  Very friendly, asked me if I needed napkins or utensils.  Very genuine.  The building was in good shape, clean.  I so wanted this food to be excellent.  Ehhh‚Ä¶ Mozzarella Sticks are frozen & didn‚Äôt have any flavor.  If you are going to keep serving these toss them in a salt, Italian seasoning mix before serving.  It will make a world of difference.  Marinara sauce was ok, nothing distinctive.  Cheeseburger Sub was very light, no real flavor & not worth the price of admission.  Salt, pepper, heavy oregano would be a good start.  I will give this place another try in the future for the simple fact they seem to genuinely care based on my interaction.  We shall see!!!",

            "text": "I placed my first online order today at hurricane Pizza Grill and was very pleased. They texted me at 25% off coupon which saved me around $6 and when I arrived to pick up the food it was just coming out right on time hot and delicious. I got the jalapeno poppers which I love and also the Philly cheese steak egg rolls which are amazing.\n\nThis was the first time I tried the online ordering because we usually always go in and sit down at the bar to eat, I was very pleased with the ease of pickup. We love going to Hurricane's Grill because of the awesome happy hour 7:00 to 9:00 drink specials and there's usually always a food special any given day of the week. Saturday is my absolute favorite half-price off ribs all day and the ribs are unbelievable.\nWhenever I come down from Boston to visit my parents in Lancaster, this is one of our favorite places and where we usually always end up when we want some delicious affordable food & drinks out...",
