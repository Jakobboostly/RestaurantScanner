My food is ready before the time they gave as an estimate.\n\nOriginal post: I've been getting delivery and carry out from this location since the early 90s. From child to adult. I prefer their pizza more than national pizza chains. This spot is legit and has good customer service, too. The pizza is ready when they say it is. The quality and ingredients are excellent.\n\nThey have really good customer service. I forgot you can sign up for their rewards program and get a free large 1 topping pizza after meeting the requirements. Plus, if you sign up for texts, they'll send you pizza deals. That comes in handy when I do not want to cook. Until next time.",

I was soooo disappointed, I was gonna feed 5 adults and now I can only feed 2. I had to spend more money somewhere else. Somebody please fix this!!!!",

          "text": "This pizza went beyond my expectations! It was our first time having Blackjack, and it exceeded any expectations I could have ever had! It was a plain pepperoni and it tasted magical! Just smelling the box when they hand you the box, you know this is gonna be a force to be reckoned with! You open the box, it's a beautiful ensemble presented before your eyes. The crust, the yummy sauce underneath the cheese, the way the melted cheese decorates said crust, and the wonderful cheery on top - the pepperoni! It just comes together so perfectly. And of course, it tasted as amazing as it looked, granted you'll need to keep a handful of napkins nearby because grease will be dripping everywhere (But it's worth all the grease it comes with)! The cheese sticks were equally as delicious (keep plenty of napkins nearby for these, too!), but in my opinion, they tasted like any other cheese sticks you get at a pizza place. I also appreciated that they gave us a very generous amount of sauce with our cheese sticks. Usually, we end up running out of marinara sauce because the container pizza places give you is very small. I was pleasantly surprised that we had plenty left, I ended up using the remaining sauce for my pizza crust (delicious crust, by the way!).  The cookie pie was also really good too, though, at our first impression of it on looks alone, we had compared the sporadic pictures of the chocolate chunks to something not as visually appealing to the human eye. But jokes aside, it's also very amazing. the most shocking for me was how well the white chocolate complimented the milk chocolate (melted cookies always taste AMAZING, though!). We had ordered through their online website and picked up the order and the staff was very friendly and always made sure that every customer in line was tended to, despite when we got there they had a giant rush.\n\nNow for all that I enjoyed from this place, there were some problems I also had. For example, we had set a time to pick up the pizza, having set a time a couple of hours from when we ordered it. Unfortunately, when we arrived to pick it up, they informed us it would require another 10 minutes before our pizza would be finished, having to wait longer than anticipated for an order we placed hours ago. As you can see in the pictures of our pizza, for how delicious it was, it was not properly cut (Thank goodness for pizza cutters, you'll never know when you'll need them!). But for how good that pizza, cheese sticks, and cookie pie,  who wouldn't wait an extra few minutes and cut the pizza themselves?",

They gave me two packages of Parmesan, no pepper and he told me that they didn't have that much. I ordered an extra large pizza. The courtesy of telling me of we don't have that much parmesan and no peppers would have been the courteous thing to do. I work hard for my money. I even gave a tip to the driver. Blackjack is making it hard for me to call them again. I think I'll make another choice the next time.",

I also added a few more toppings for small price, as well as some delicious Cinnabread!!\n~Only* downfall was that store closes early for pickup/carry out, & we don't live that far from store and delivery fees will add-up quick! Didn't mind paying them that day cuz we had the free Pizza coupon. Blackjack has always been a big favorite of mine and I will keep enjoying it thoroughly thank you!\n~~MyKey T.",

My food is ready before the time they gave as an estimate.\n\nOriginal post: I've been getting delivery and carry out from this location since the early 90s. From child to adult. I prefer their pizza more than national pizza chains. This spot is legit and has good customer service, too. The pizza is ready when they say it is. The quality and ingredients are excellent.\n\nThey have really good customer service. I forgot you can sign up for their rewards program and get a free large 1 topping pizza after meeting the requirements. Plus, if you sign up for texts, they'll send you pizza deals. That comes in handy when I do not want to cook. Until next time.",

          "text": "So after a 12.hour shift i park my vehicle I see the delivery driver with my pizza. I jokingly say hey you have my pizza he responds no it's not your pizza I say yes I I live at my apartment he immediately decides that I was being abusive and he refused to give me my pizza, so I confronted him he had no reason to keep my pizza not only did I not get my pizza he lied to his manager about what happened, even though I will admit I did call him a few names because he kept my pizza for no reason, I spoke to the manager on duty she was a real unprofessional person, I demanded my pizzacshe refused to even bring it to me so with that being said I'm done with Blackjack Pizza we have ordered from them for 7 years, and I order at least once a month, and during football season I order a lot on Sunday not anymore this driver  had the nerve comment to supposedly call the police for keeping my food so, I know my wife is going to go to the store tomorrow to talk to the store manager but this dude was a complete douchebag, and the night manager hung up on me without even acknowledging he was wrong for keeping my food. So the driver has the right to.keep what I paid for? I will be curious about how this comes out. See If the owner has the courage to call me and explain how a driver can just keep a customers food because he couldn't take a joke? Over 7 years we have supported this business because it's a Vet owned and I'm a Combat Vet. That support ended unless i get a phone call or a follow up.that is acceptable. This driver lied to.cover his ass. You guys pick a driver over a 7 year customer. Your call I've made up.my mind.\nBottom line all this driver had to do if he doubted it was my order was to call the contact number. It would of been verified by my wife. This driver overstepped his authority keeping my pizza order. He needs thicker skin. What a total loser.\n\nAnd of course the store took the side of the driver and had the balls to treat my wife like some criminal telling us they prefer no more contact until the owner contacts us. Regardless of the outcome 7 years of being a loyal customer were done ordering from your store tons of pizza options with better quality and lower prices. Keep protecting your low life pizza drivers over you customers see how that works out. Bye bye. Pizza hut you have new business.\n\nAnd you driver 100 percent lied about what happened,  bit its all good your response was not  only weak but shows you are weak and will toe the company line Owner. That's fine better pizza places in Aurora then yours with pleasure I will and have formed a new pizza patrnership.with fantastic food. I wish you nothing but failure.",

The courtesy of telling me of we don't have that much parmesan and no peppers would have been the courteous thing to do. I work hard for my money. I even gave a tip to the driver.
