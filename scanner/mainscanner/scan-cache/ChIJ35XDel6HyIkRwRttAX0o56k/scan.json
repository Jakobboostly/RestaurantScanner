          "text": "We have been searching for a great pizza in the York area for years! We finally found our gold mine. This by far is the best pizza in York county and we've tried a lot of them. The funny thing is it's 5 minutes from her house. We never thought to look so close to home. We didn't think we could be so lucky, but we are. Crust is perfect cheese is nice and buttery. We've ordered twice now in the last week and our experience has been 100%. It says a lot to me if you get great customer service over the phone which this little pizza shop nails it. Look no further. You got to give this place a try. It's fabulous.",

When I called to ask about my order, the lady rushed and said I don‚Äôt see your food here so it should be there any minute I‚Äôm sorry for the delay. Ok cool I‚Äôll wait. Waited another 45  (total of two hours) mins and nothing showed. When I called back I was told my food should have been delivered then she proceeded to tell me she never got my order. Ok thank you however if she would have taken a minute to look the first time I called I could have placed a new order or ordered somewhere else instead she proceeded to argue with me. So I ended the call she then called back to apologize but couldn‚Äôt actually apologize or even let me talk. As a business owner myself, that‚Äôs very poor customer service. I understand things happen but that was definitely handled improperly and for that alone I won‚Äôt be ordering from there anymore.",

          "text": "I hate to give negative reviews, but I was incredibly disappointed in our order earlier this week. We've gotten fantastic, consistently great food here many times over the years, which is why I'm really surprised that this happened. I realize food costs, fuel prices, etc. have skyrocketed, so I fully understand the price of my order. My gripe is the portion sizes & quality of what we received for an almost $80 order.\nPictured above is the $9 \"large\" Caesar salad. That's a medium clam shell takeout box; salad had exactly 2 olives, 3 grape tomatoes sliced in half, some cheap parmesan dusted on top, and a packet of dressing. We figured there had been a mistake, but after a phone call to check, nope! That's the large. One of the pizzas was undercooked. The other had super skimpy toppings and was so dried out and tough. I was told the 2 \"large\" subs (which also arrived in those medium boxes) were good, so there's that.\nI hope this was just an off night because I'm hesitant to order from here again. :(",

My gripe is the portion sizes & quality of what we received for an almost $80 order.\nPictured above is the $9 \"large\" Caesar salad. That's a medium clam shell takeout box; salad had exactly 2 olives, 3 grape tomatoes sliced in half, some cheap parmesan dusted on top, and a packet of dressing. We figured there had been a mistake, but after a phone call to check, nope! That's the large. One of the pizzas was undercooked. The other had super skimpy toppings and was so dried out and tough.

            "text": "Ordered online, order never showed up. When I called to ask about my order, the lady rushed and said I don‚Äôt see your food here so it should be there any minute I‚Äôm sorry for the delay. Ok cool I‚Äôll wait. Waited another 45  (total of two hours) mins and nothing showed. When I called back I was told my food should have been delivered then she proceeded to tell me she never got my order. Ok thank you however if she would have taken a minute to look the first time I called I could have placed a new order or ordered somewhere else instead she proceeded to argue with me. So I ended the call she then called back to apologize but couldn‚Äôt actually apologize or even let me talk. As a business owner myself, that‚Äôs very poor customer service. I understand things happen but that was definitely handled improperly and for that alone I won‚Äôt be ordering from there anymore.",

            "text": "We have been searching for a great pizza in the York area for years! We finally found our gold mine. This by far is the best pizza in York county and we've tried a lot of them. The funny thing is it's 5 minutes from her house. We never thought to look so close to home. We didn't think we could be so lucky, but we are. Crust is perfect cheese is nice and buttery. We've ordered twice now in the last week and our experience has been 100%. It says a lot to me if you get great customer service over the phone which this little pizza shop nails it. Look no further. You got to give this place a try. It's fabulous.",

            "text": "I hate to give negative reviews, but I was incredibly disappointed in our order earlier this week. We've gotten fantastic, consistently great food here many times over the years, which is why I'm really surprised that this happened. I realize food costs, fuel prices, etc. have skyrocketed, so I fully understand the price of my order. My gripe is the portion sizes & quality of what we received for an almost $80 order.\nPictured above is the $9 \"large\" Caesar salad. That's a medium clam shell takeout box; salad had exactly 2 olives, 3 grape tomatoes sliced in half, some cheap parmesan dusted on top, and a packet of dressing. We figured there had been a mistake, but after a phone call to check, nope! That's the large. One of the pizzas was undercooked. The other had super skimpy toppings and was so dried out and tough. I was told the 2 \"large\" subs (which also arrived in those medium boxes) were good, so there's that.\nI hope this was just an off night because I'm hesitant to order from here again. :(",
