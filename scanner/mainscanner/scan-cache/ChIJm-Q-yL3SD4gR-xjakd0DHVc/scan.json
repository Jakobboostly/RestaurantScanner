Though to be fair, they always find me.\n\nStill, the food was great. We tried the burgers, salads, and pizza, and everything was genuinely delicious.\n\nThe service was kind and welcoming, though not super knowledgeable about the menu or beers. Also, the server depended on us to remember what we ordered and some of us started eating the wrong salads (main dish versus side salads).\n\nOverall, a solid spot. Maybe bring bug spray if you‚Äôre mosquito-prone and sitting inside (or out) on a summer night.",

First time I have a 10/10 pizza and a 10/10 burger from the same place! The fries are fine I would say 7/10. Chicken is 7/10 as well. No one can have it all but burger and pizza top notch especially with the declining small cheval, this is a winner. Keep up the great service and great food! (Excuse my poor photography skills) . pro tip: go to the restaurant exactly when the time says to be there, don‚Äôt go too early. They are efficient and plan well",

Though to be fair, they always find me.\n\nStill, the food was great. We tried the burgers, salads, and pizza, and everything was genuinely delicious.\n\nThe service was kind and welcoming, though not super knowledgeable about the menu or beers. Also, the server depended on us to remember what we ordered and some of us started eating the wrong salads (main dish versus side salads).\n\nOverall, a solid spot. Maybe bring bug spray if you‚Äôre mosquito-prone and sitting inside (or out) on a summer night.",

They also give back to the community. Could not recommend enough!\n\nJust when I thought I couldn‚Äôt love them more, we hosted a party at the Logan Square location- it exceeded my expectations! Robert is a gem of a human! And Kelly, our server, was phenomenal! Everyone had what they needed at all times. 10/10",

          "text": "Great food and friendly vibes, but be prepared for a warm, breezy (and buggy) atmosphere. It was pretty hot inside with no A/C and the doors open, which let in some mosquitos. Though to be fair, they always find me.\n\nStill, the food was great. We tried the burgers, salads, and pizza, and everything was genuinely delicious.\n\nThe service was kind and welcoming, though not super knowledgeable about the menu or beers. Also, the server depended on us to remember what we ordered and some of us started eating the wrong salads (main dish versus side salads).\n\nOverall, a solid spot. Maybe bring bug spray if you‚Äôre mosquito-prone and sitting inside (or out) on a summer night.",

          "text": "DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR. If you're ordering online this should be a good pizza. If you are in person, your results may vary.  I live down the street and really love the pizza, but if you're ordering in person you are going to have a bad time. I sat at the bar, ordered a beer and pizza to-go and watched 30 pizzas go out immaculate.  My personal pizza was the only burned on in the bunch - an hour later.\n\nUltimately,  this a remote order location. Don't waste your time physically showing up - that will only lead to the longest wait time of your life, but also a pizza that takes second place to mobile orders.",

First time I have a 10/10 pizza and a 10/10 burger from the same place! The fries are fine I would say 7/10. Chicken is 7/10 as well. No one can have it all but burger and pizza top notch especially with the declining small cheval, this is a winner. Keep up the great service and great food! (Excuse my poor photography skills) . pro tip: go to the restaurant exactly when the time says to be there, don‚Äôt go too early. They are efficient and plan well",

I ordered the burger meal with fries, and I wasn‚Äôt fully satisfied with this place. Many people told me that this burger spot had amazing burgers for its value, so I decided to see how it would fare against other burger spots In this case, it wasn‚Äôt all great. It‚Äôs a solid burger, but far too expensive when I can get 2 or 3 burgers at local competitors. My advice - focus on the flavor within the burger and avoid the excessive flavour masking. 6.5/10.",

For me at least, it's getting a little outside the price range for the amount of food I'm getting.\n\nUpdate 3/15/25: Prices are still a little high but the food has remained very tasty and fresh. Tried a new style pizza today, The Space Balls. Great option if you don't eat pork like myself and want some meat. Added pictures as well",

We tried the burgers, salads, and pizza, and everything was genuinely delicious.\n\nThe service was kind and welcoming, though not super knowledgeable about the menu or beers. Also, the server depended on us to remember what we ordered and some of us started eating the wrong salads (main dish versus side salads).\n\nOverall, a solid spot.
