The food is consistently awesome, and the one delivery guy that always comes through at 10pm or later at night is the most courteous of delivery guys I have met, and I've been in the delivery business myself back in the day, so I get the late night requests. He comes on time and is very respectful. And the team that makes the pies..yall have always met expectations! Please never change cuz yall never disappoint. I've been ordering the last 3 or 4 months. I make my own pizzas as my go to, but when I'm lazy I always hit yall up cuz I know I'll always get a great product! I appreciate your service and dedication, Idk what yall put into your pies but it's great and I reccomend everyone i know to yall!",

They have great pizza and a lot of side items, but their website doesn't work very well. I've lost my entire order several times when I went to order or when I had to adjust my order for being too expensive, I hadn't spent enough to get a delivery or anything else. So, great pizza if you can afford it, but it mostly best as a pick-up or in-restaurant lunch.",

          "text": "I recently moved to Hendersonville and was in the mood for pizza. A neighbor had told me that they liked Pizza Hut. So I tried a medium regular crust double pepperoni, my usual. It was horrible. The crust was thick and chewy and very ‚Äúbready‚Äù (you know what I mean). So the next time I wanted pizza I tried Fox‚Äôs Pizza Den. The service was excellent. The pizza came on time and was very good. Unlike Pizza Hut there was a generous amount of cheese and the sauce underneath was flavorful. And Fox‚Äôs understood what I meant by double pepperoni. But best of all, the crust was crispy! Very good.",

I gave them the order confirmation number that I had, my cell phone number, and informed them that the money have been received out of my account. The manager on duty did not realize that the worker did not mute the phone and we could hear her talking in the background saying that we did not pay. In addition whenever my fiance went to pick up the food he was treated like we did not believe him after showing them the receipt. We were also told to wait an additional 25 minutes before coming to pick up the pizza. He waited that long and it is now 8 and he is still sitting at the store waiting on our food.",

I called them to ask where the driver was cuz he hadn't shown up at my house ans drove to my work and the pizza wasn't there. I work 15 minutes from my house. I don't think it was ever there. Never got my food or my money. Tried to get it back from door dash. There was no photo uploaded to the app. And the woman at the restaurant said it had been delivered to the empty parking lot",

Restaurant has pictures up of people completing the challenge and a rule list on the wall. Guy working the counter said they do not do the challenge anymore. Got some buffalo wings and they were atrocious. Tasted like someone vomited on them. Would not go back under any circumstance.",
