The individual running the shop, I believe Suzanne, asked me if I was okay with how the pizza was cooked. I'll let her know that it was a bit too crispy for my liking, I understand that Dave Portnoy would tell me I got it wrong, and another pizza which was perfect to my liking was prepared.

This is now our favorite pizza place. My husband and I will definitely make the drive from SLC to go to this amazing pizzeria in Fairview again. The mini donuts are incredible too! Thank you!",

He gave me a bag free of charge and they were exceptionally tasty! I will be back. Would highly recommend.\n\nEdit: 9/12 I ordered a pizza and some tasty donuts for pickup. The individual running the shop, I believe Suzanne, asked me if I was okay with how the pizza was cooked. I'll let her know that it was a bit too crispy for my liking, I understand that Dave Portnoy would tell me I got it wrong, and another pizza which was perfect to my liking was prepared. I appreciated that. Also, the chocolate delight donuts were phenomenal!",

The price for what you get is fair, reasonable and less than national chains. A fun bonus is the donuts they make fresh right there in front of you, a favorite of everyone. We loved the cheese sticks, which were unique since they were stuffed with cheese and topped with a really delicious topping that added extra flavor and crunch. The salad is fantastic too with multiple fancy mixed lettuce types, and included among other fresh veggies what appeared to be fire roasted tomatoes, and really flavorful fresh tasting ranch dressing that seems like it must be made fresh in house. Overall my family and I would highly recommend Papa's Pizzeria and will return at our next opportunity without hesitation.",

The young lady running the counter up front was a bit scattered and seemed overwhelmed with the donut machine (it stopped working and they had to refund us our order. We had to ask twice if we were going to be getting them, on the second time they told us it broke! ) the guy in the back popped in and out of the kitchen and wasn‚Äôt rushing at all to make any pizzas. I know small town life is a slower paced life, but for them to say that they are swamped and there be just what I could see hanging up‚Ä¶having attended culinary school and worked in busy big city restaurants‚Ä¶.they take ‚Äúbusy‚Äù to another level‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt busy but they were scattered.\nOn that note I wouldn‚Äôt make any special trips out to try this pizza again, I don‚Äôt think I would stop by either to get that pizza when I‚Äôm back in that area. Pretty good food for me doesn‚Äôt make up for my time and their lack of communication.",

From the moment it hit the table, I could tell this wasn‚Äôt going to be a casual meal. The crust had that perfect balance‚Äîcrispy on the outside, soft and airy inside, with just the right amount of char to make it dangerously addictive.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the sauce. It‚Äôs not just sauce; it‚Äôs a slow, deliberate build of flavor that lingers long after each bite. A subtle sweetness hits first, followed by a bold punch of herbs and spices that makes you stop and pay attention. And the cheese? Well, it doesn‚Äôt just sit there. It stretches, it pulls, it acts. Like it knows exactly what it‚Äôs doing to you.\n\nBut the real magic is in the toppings. Every ingredient feels like it‚Äôs been carefully chosen, like it had to prove its worth before earning a spot on the pie. The toppings aren‚Äôt ordinary, no there robust, with just enough spice to make your mouth tingle. The vegetables? Fresh, crisp, and bursting with flavor, almost as if they were plucked from some enchanted garden. The whole thing is a symphony of delicious flavors exploding in your mouth.\n\nIt‚Äôs the kind of pizza that makes you rethink what pizza can be. It‚Äôs bold without being arrogant, indulgent without being over the top. And as you take each bite, there‚Äôs this quiet voice in the back of your head asking, How is this even allowed to be this good?\n\nPapa‚Äôs Pizzeria isn‚Äôt just a pizza spot; it‚Äôs an experience. One that you‚Äôll be thinking about long after the last slice is gone.",

We also got a box of their peanut butter chocolate donuts, and they were SOOO good. We will definitely be going back soon!\n\nOne down side was that there wasn't much space for sitting down inside, and the outdoor space wasn't an option with it being January. Despite it being small, it was a cute place, though. Another thing that would be nice to see is a website with a menu. Definitely not deal-breakers, but these elements would simply add to the experience.",

The individual running the shop, I believe Suzanne, asked me if I was okay with how the pizza was cooked. I'll let her know that it was a bit too crispy for my liking, I understand that Dave Portnoy would tell me I got it wrong, and another pizza which was perfect to my liking was prepared. I appreciated that. Also, the chocolate delight donuts were phenomenal!",
