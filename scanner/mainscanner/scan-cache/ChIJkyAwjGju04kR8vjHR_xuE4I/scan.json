We ordered the Amoreus, Senor Pescado, Maple Sunshine & Eli's Horchata Cream Ale.\n\nThe Amoreus was pretty good, a light and refreshing Lager. The Maple Sunshine was really interesting, you can definitely smell and taste the Maple and it leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. I really liked the Horchata Cream Ale, it tastes kind of like Cream soda. The Senor Pescado was also crisp and refreshing.\n\nTo eat, we ordered the Grit Cakes and the Pork Belly Rice Bowl. We did want to order the crab rangoon dip but they didn't have any. Food came pretty quickly. The Grit Cakes were light and fluffy and very good and crispy. They're quite big though and it comes with 4 large pieces. I did like the pork belly rice bowl as well but didn't fully enjoy the Chipotle ranch dip that we got on the side mixed.\n\nOverall, a cool place to stop into and the beers are good. Friendly service and quiet. They do have a lot of seating indoors and a patio thats open as well.",

The menu looked intriguing and the beer sounded good. We were not disappointed. Service was wonderful. We were promptly greeted by a friendly hostess who welcomed us. She accepted that we  were traveling brewery tourists, and got us a sticker to share with our local Brewery. Our waitress promptly offered Waters and multiple menus. I will share some of those, but the regular menu was too extensive to copy here. We chose the Schwartz beer and the Vienna Lager. Those were quite acceptable. I would have no problem coming back for more of those another night.  I had the Maple Sunshine for dessert, which was more of an acquired taste. The pizza of the month, McKenna's Bruschetta, was quite wonderful with a thick but light tasting crust, just the right amount of cheese and lots of flavor with the oil and garlic base, mozzarella, grilled chicken and fresh bruschetta. A side salad was not on the menu, but they provided one, which proved perfect for my wife. The place will seat quite a crowd, so I doubt you will be shut out if you show up on a busier night than a Monday. They even have games to keep the kids busy if you want to spend a little more. (I think parents always love a chance to have the kids busy somewhere else.) I have to give this place a 5/5. If you are passing through or a local, keep it in mind.",

          "text": "Pit stopped here on our road trip. We found parking right out front Tuesday evening. We were sat right away and immediately attended to. They offer a beer Flight for $12. We ordered the Amoreus, Senor Pescado, Maple Sunshine & Eli's Horchata Cream Ale.\n\nThe Amoreus was pretty good, a light and refreshing Lager. The Maple Sunshine was really interesting, you can definitely smell and taste the Maple and it leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. I really liked the Horchata Cream Ale, it tastes kind of like Cream soda. The Senor Pescado was also crisp and refreshing.\n\nTo eat, we ordered the Grit Cakes and the Pork Belly Rice Bowl. We did want to order the crab rangoon dip but they didn't have any. Food came pretty quickly. The Grit Cakes were light and fluffy and very good and crispy. They're quite big though and it comes with 4 large pieces. I did like the pork belly rice bowl as well but didn't fully enjoy the Chipotle ranch dip that we got on the side mixed.\n\nOverall, a cool place to stop into and the beers are good. Friendly service and quiet. They do have a lot of seating indoors and a patio thats open as well.",

Like I mentioned she was working incredibly hard so no discredit toward her. I‚Äôm not sure if you need to pay more to attract more staff or if it‚Äôs a retention issue‚Ä¶regardless needs to be addressed. I come to this place often and this isn‚Äôt the first occurrence.

          "text": "We were passing through Batavia, New York on a Monday night. It looked like the only brewery in town that was open was the Eli Fish Brewing Company. The menu looked intriguing and the beer sounded good. We were not disappointed. Service was wonderful. We were promptly greeted by a friendly hostess who welcomed us. She accepted that we  were traveling brewery tourists, and got us a sticker to share with our local Brewery. Our waitress promptly offered Waters and multiple menus. I will share some of those, but the regular menu was too extensive to copy here. We chose the Schwartz beer and the Vienna Lager. Those were quite acceptable. I would have no problem coming back for more of those another night.  I had the Maple Sunshine for dessert, which was more of an acquired taste. The pizza of the month, McKenna's Bruschetta, was quite wonderful with a thick but light tasting crust, just the right amount of cheese and lots of flavor with the oil and garlic base, mozzarella, grilled chicken and fresh bruschetta. A side salad was not on the menu, but they provided one, which proved perfect for my wife. The place will seat quite a crowd, so I doubt you will be shut out if you show up on a busier night than a Monday. They even have games to keep the kids busy if you want to spend a little more. (I think parents always love a chance to have the kids busy somewhere else.) I have to give this place a 5/5. If you are passing through or a local, keep it in mind.",

They've not only a great assortment of beers and ales, but also ciders, wine, and mixed drinks. Furthermore, the place is family-friendly!

I had a pretty big order for my family and spent over $100. I got The Brewhouse Jambalaya, and it was a scam. The order describes what you would expect based on the name. A mix of chicken, sausage and shrimp over rice in a spicy broth. What I got was rice with 6 jumbo, tailed shrimp. Literally no sausage or chicken in this thing at all. Not a single piece of either. I was beyond disappointed, I don't even particularly like shrimp, I almost told them to skip it. But given the fact it's jambalaya I expected more sausage than anything, paired with a couple pieces of shrimp and chicken. So would I have gotten soupy rice for $20 if I said hold the shrimp? I genuinely feel robbed. Maybe they forgot to put the ingredients in mine, but I won't gamble spending almost $20 for this dish again.",

The servers were great about taking our group's orders so that we could take advantage of happy hour, however, there was nothing vegetarian/pescetarian on the HH menu so I couldn't take advantage of the specials. I enjoyed a flight of beers (and was happy to see they have a wide variety of styles!). All of our food was delivered promptly. I ended up ordering the mahi sandwich, and it was delicious, so I didn't feel as bad that I had to pay full price. Looking forward to coming here again, but hope there are more veggie friendly options (other than salads) in the future.",

There have been ebbs and flows in the quality of the food and service due to staff turnover at times but they have never failed to make things right. Overall, I love the rotating selection of beers (though Bad, Bad Leroy Brown is never on tap long enough!) and the menu has kept this chubby guy satisfied. We have seen several restaurants in the center space but love that Matty's Pizza seems to be there to stay.\n\nThe atmosphere can be loud but that should be expected in such a large, old building. They have made several improvements to the space since opening and I've always felt comfortable there. Keep in mind it is a craft brewery first and foremost, so if you're expecting a quiet, pinkies out type meal this probably isn't the place for you. I've seen a lot of larger groups and families with kids of all ages happily dining there before though. We've taken guests from out of town on multiple occasions and they've always been able to find food and drink that they were happy with.",

She tried her best to keep up,  but couldn‚Äôt. She worked very very hard but I didn‚Äôt receive any service for about 35 minutes after getting my food. Like I mentioned she was working incredibly hard so no discredit toward her. I‚Äôm not sure if you need to pay more to attract more staff or if it‚Äôs a retention issue‚Ä¶regardless needs to be addressed. I come to this place often and this isn‚Äôt the first occurrence. I think your food is good and beer is incredible.",

            "text": "Ordered pick up, and was impressed by the dining room. It's a very nice place. Pick up was quick and easy. The food is a different story however. I had a pretty big order for my family and spent over $100. I got The Brewhouse Jambalaya, and it was a scam. The order describes what you would expect based on the name. A mix of chicken, sausage and shrimp over rice in a spicy broth. What I got was rice with 6 jumbo, tailed shrimp. Literally no sausage or chicken in this thing at all. Not a single piece of either. I was beyond disappointed, I don't even particularly like shrimp, I almost told them to skip it. But given the fact it's jambalaya I expected more sausage than anything, paired with a couple pieces of shrimp and chicken. So would I have gotten soupy rice for $20 if I said hold the shrimp? I genuinely feel robbed. Maybe they forgot to put the ingredients in mine, but I won't gamble spending almost $20 for this dish again.",
