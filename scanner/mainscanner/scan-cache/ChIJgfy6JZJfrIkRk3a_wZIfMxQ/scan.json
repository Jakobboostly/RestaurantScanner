          "text": "Visited Sam Jones BBQ in downtown Raleigh and was pleasantly surprised!\n\nAs someone from Eastern NC, I‚Äôm usually skeptical of BBQ spots because too many places try to put a ‚Äúflare‚Äù on it. If you know Eastern NC BBQ, you know all you need is to cook it low and slow with a good vinegar-based sauce.\n\nAs an Offline member, I decided to give it a try‚Äîand I tell you what, I‚Äôll be back again and again! The BBQ was chopped perfectly and packed with flavor. Their house sweet sauce was delicious, and the vinegar sauce was just as good. They even had Texas Pete on the table, the music was right, and the sweet tea tasted like it had a whole bag of sugar in it‚Ä¶ just like an old school BBQ joint.\n\nSide note: the baked beans were next-level‚Äîloaded with hamburger meat and onions, just like something you‚Äôd get at a backyard cookout. And let‚Äôs not forget the slaw! It‚Äôs rare to find really good slaw, especially on a sandwich, but theirs was spot on.\n\nOrdering is done at the bar, and the service was amazing! I went at lunch when it wasn‚Äôt busy, and the staff was friendly, the restaurant was spotless, and my food was out before I even sat down.\n\nThis spot is the real deal. I‚Äôll definitely be back!",

We got a bunch of stuff so I got to taste a bit of everything. The wings and brisket were Amazing!!! The service was good, we sat outside so it wasn‚Äôt the traditional waiter taking order system. You have to order using a QR code and the food comes out. Everything was great, I think my expectations were a bit too high. The cornbread was awful! Only reason I‚Äôm taking away a star. If you‚Äôre going to have a smoke house, you have to get the cornbread right! Other than that, it was a good experience.",

To start the ribs were not the usual smoked ribs that fall off the bone... they were pretty fatty and chewy. The cornbread was downright awful... it was not edible. The mac n cheese side was also not very good. I got the loaded baked potato as well which similar to the rest of my meal was flavorless. Very disappointing bbq food, even though the plate looked fantastic.",

To start the ribs were not the usual smoked ribs that fall off the bone... they were pretty fatty and chewy. The cornbread was downright awful... it was not edible. The mac n cheese side was also not very good. I got the loaded baked potato as well which similar to the rest of my meal was flavorless. Very disappointing bbq food, even though the plate looked fantastic.",

If you know Eastern NC BBQ, you know all you need is to cook it low and slow with a good vinegar-based sauce.\n\nAs an Offline member, I decided to give it a try‚Äîand I tell you what, I‚Äôll be back again and again! The BBQ was chopped perfectly and packed with flavor. Their house sweet sauce was delicious, and the vinegar sauce was just as good. They even had Texas Pete on the table, the music was right, and the sweet tea tasted like it had a whole bag of sugar in it‚Ä¶ just like an old school BBQ joint.\n\nSide note: the baked beans were next-level‚Äîloaded with hamburger meat and onions, just like something you‚Äôd get at a backyard cookout. And let‚Äôs not forget the slaw! It‚Äôs rare to find really good slaw, especially on a sandwich, but theirs was spot on.\n\nOrdering is done at the bar, and the service was amazing! I went at lunch when it wasn‚Äôt busy, and the staff was friendly, the restaurant was spotless, and my food was out before I even sat down.\n\nThis spot is the real deal. I‚Äôll definitely be back!",

Sides are generous, larger than some other places, so you‚Äôll have plenty to eat. Small parking lot adjacent. More street parking in the area. I‚Äôll be back to try the other items.",

We got a bunch of stuff so I got to taste a bit of everything. The wings and brisket were Amazing!!! The service was good, we sat outside so it wasn‚Äôt the traditional waiter taking order system. You have to order using a QR code and the food comes out. Everything was great, I think my expectations were a bit too high. The cornbread was awful! Only reason I‚Äôm taking away a star. If you‚Äôre going to have a smoke house, you have to get the cornbread right! Other than that, it was a good experience.",
