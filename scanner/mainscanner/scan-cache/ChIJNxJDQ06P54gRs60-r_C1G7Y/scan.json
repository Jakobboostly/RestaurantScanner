It was fresh, and had incredible flavor. The cheese bread also comes with marinara dipping sauce.\n\nThe main reason I had issues enjoying the food is the pizza. The crust was not crispy but, it was dry enough. I could tell the cheese was also dried out. Maybe if the crust was flavored, it may have been enjoyable somewhat but, this was not the case. I just feel the pizza may have been re-baked one too many times.\n\nI will try them again cause if the cheese bread can taste the way it did, then the pizza can be good too.\n\nI really want to like this place since it is pretty close to my home and there are not many non-chain restaurants to choose from  so, will see in the future.",

Yum!!)\nI had the lunch special of salad, garlic bread and a drink and thought the bread was quite good.  Salad was slightly above average. Sweet tea is just right: not too sweet.\nService is good.   I gave the atmosphere a 4 simply because it is so open and not warm and cozy.  But the chairs are comfortable and not just metal.  So that is a plus.\n\nI spent extra money because I wanted pizza for later.  I‚Äôd say their prices are about what lunch would cost for one person at most tip paying restaurants.",

          "text": "We used to go to the Josie's in Orlando and the wings were always my favorite, so we were excited to have a location in Clermont. It's a casual setting with some bar seats at the counter with a good number of tables for seating. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers, a small cheese pizza, and some wings. Everything was really tasty and just like I remembered it from 10+ years ago. The butter garlic Parmesan wings are so good, perfectly crispy without being dry. A lot of cheese pizzas taste the same but theirs just tastes better, good sauce and cheese blend makes a big difference. Service was friendly and the music brought back a lot of nostalgia for me. I'll definitely come back for more wings!",

The wings were (10) hot and (10) bbq the hot wings were saturated in the sauce, So much sauce that the wings were swimming in sauce, the  take out box was full of wing sauce and the wings were just saturated. The bbq sauce was just dumped over the wings, most of the wings on the bottom had no sauce they were not tossed in bbq sauce, just smothered with sauce on top of the wings. We were extremely disappointed, and we felt like we wasted our money. The cook could definitely without a doubt use more training on how to properly prepare the wings. I hope that this review will help and is taken constructively. I hate spending my hard earned money on anything that is inadequate. I will still continue to go to Josie‚Äôs Orlando location ,but sadly it will be a while before I return to the Clermont location. I am hoping that the Clermont location will do better in the future. I generally do not leave reviews, but I felt compelled to share my thoughts and I hope that Josie‚Äôs really does better in the future. And in closing, I now know that I must inspect the food before leaving any establishment",

          "text": "The owners response speaks for itself in the sense that they couldnt manage to even get my name right when it's directly in front of them, they did not address the inaccurate pricing on their menu which was our largest problem, and despite it sounding like they went back to look at cameras, they got quite a few things wrong. First off, no server checked on us after our order was taken. Someone else may have gotten our napkins, after I called them over because our server was not coming over. Other servers did walk near our table but no one checked on us, they were waiting on other tables. Im the one who asked for the check because no one was coming back- my husband went up to ask why a personal pizza was almost $20 when the menu DOES NOT LIST ANY TOPPINGS AS PREMIUM. Which was my main issue. Funny, the owner doesnt address the price innacuracy at all in their response. We were both sitting on our phones... because we had been finished with our food for quite awhile and no one was coming over with the bill. Were we supposed to just stare at each other until our server noticed we were finished?\nAlso the fact that you dont know what a pizza oven is... speaks for itself. Google it. I truly meant what I said when I said its something I could make at home, but to be honest? I have and could make a better pizza at home. Piesanos may be similar in price to yours, but the quality is far higher. And the service is insanely better.\n\nI had high hopes for this place and was really let down. Our server essentially ignored us. When I finally went up to ask for our check, the bill was higher than expected. One of our personal pizzas was ringing up as $18.99. I asked about it and they said we got premium toppings. Nowhere on the menu did it say anything about some toppings costing more than others, it just says personal pizzas are $1.50 per topping. Basically I got ripped off and 100% got overcharged. The girl serving us was rude and dismissive as well as being inattentive. Id love to address her by name instead of as \"the girl\" but she didnt give us a name. As far as the quality of the pizza itself, its maybe a 5/10. It looks like something youd throw together at home. The quality was not there for the prices they charge. If you want good pizza thats actually worth the cost (because this place is WAY overpriced) Piesanos down Citrus Tower has way better service, the pizzas are cooked in an actual pizza oven, and the pricing is transparent. Plus, free bread. Id highly reccomend that establishment over this one if you want pizza thats actually good.",

Extremely high quality food. (Literally my daughter will only eat Josie‚Äôs pizza). We always order wings, which are our favorite!! And the onion rings are also a musthave for an appetizer.\n2. Amazingly great choice of music.\n3. Atmosphere is always just right. Never too packed and can always TALK, not shout.\n4. Lastly, and probably our favorite part about being at Josie‚Äôs, is the amazing staff, especially Alex who has a Josie‚Äôs brew in my husbands hand as we walk in and  knows our order from memory. Salgado is just as amazing, respectful and also knows our order by heart. The rest of staff is great as well. David, the other owner, always makes it a point to stop at our table to ask how our family is doing, talk about baseball, cars, etc‚Ä¶.he has seen our kids grow.",

So upon my delivery they told me to cancel the order without reimbursement for the time I took to drive there and turned me away because I didn‚Äôt have a hot bag. Not aware that I need one since it‚Äôs not required for me to have one. I shouldn‚Äôt have to cancel an order because they don‚Äôt make their food hot enough for a 5 min drive!\nI‚Äôve previously picked up an order to this restaurant prior without being asked for one. So this is really surprising. So if they added this recently as their policy they should provide one. I don‚Äôt work for them. I‚Äôm an outside vendor.",

          "text": "Was excited to try the new pizza place since it said NY style pizza. Was very disappointed when we opened the box and immediately saw it was definitely not NY style pizza. Breadsticks were good. I would try the wings if I went back, but I definitely would not get the pizza again.\n\nEditing my response for the owner reply... I like to give honest reviews, so I gave my honest review of how my family felt about our order. We added this to our Friday night order out and spent around $70, which I feel allows me to give my honest opinion. As someone from the East Coast who is used to a completely different type of NY style pizza (very large fat Neapolitan style with crust you can fold in half), this was not like that so that's how my review was based. I did say the breadsticks were good and I would try the wings. All feedback should be appreciated, not just perfect reviews..",

Needed to be more well done and seriously Piesano‚Äôs gives you more bang flavor wise for the price of their pizza. Josie‚Äôs is a big high on the price of their pies and extremely overpriced on the large Caesar‚Äôs salad. When we mentioned the portion size for two at $10 was small the manager said ‚Äúwell, normally it‚Äôs a bit bigger‚Äù. REALLY, that‚Äôs what you say to your customers?? She proactively took it back but maybe added 2 Tablespoons of romaine to the salad. B\n\nManager tried to make everything right but we could tell they were happy to get rid of us seniors. I assumed they knew we would never be back so wrote us off. In the restaurant industry that‚Äôs a mistake as we live in a large senior community. The other servers were ok but seemed poorly trained.. No atmosphere. You could use a few cheery pictures on the wall. Very plain tables spaced apart.\n\nIn summary, this chain isn‚Äôt seeking out  the senior population but will probably be fine with the younger population of commuters as Swigs is around the corner",

The pizza was so good, delicious and wholesome - definitely NOT Domino's!! My husband and I moved to Lockhart and drove back to Metrowest just to get Josie's (since moved to Lake County). One day driving down 27 I saw a familiar sign and my excitement was off the charts. No more chain pizza.  Thank you Josie's for coming to Clermont.

We ate from the lunch menu, which made the price very affordable. The artichoke and spinach calzone was better than the plain cheese pizza, although the pizza sauce was fresh and authentic.\n\nThe one drawback noted was the thickness of the crust. While still foldable, the crust was floppy, soggy and very thin. This may just be a preference thing, but a large slice should remain foldable and firm.\n\nWill definitely be going back for a quick bite at anytime. Well done!",

No prices on the menu when we got there- so took awhile for waitress to bring over the one machine that had prices.  We got teriyaki wings, a calzone and a meatball sub and fries,2 drinks & a beer.  Now out of 4 items- the only good on was the fries. Hot and crispy. The wings were no where near crispy- the skin was chewy- worse wings I have ever had. I wanted to turn them back but the other 2 said it would take forever so I just ate 2 (took the skin off)and took rest home to air fry. No one asked me if I wanted them chewy, crispy or extra crispy- never mentioned it. ( per another review) The calzone was over cooked , almost burnt looking in top and the meatball sub was also overheated and dry. Meatballs were way over cooked. I do t know if pizza oven was too hot or what. I don‚Äôt think meatballs were made in house( didn‚Äôt taste like it)\nWe eat out a lot as usually just 2 of us .\nObviously we will not be going back again.",

Yum!!)\nI had the lunch special of salad, garlic bread and a drink and thought the bread was quite good.  Salad was slightly above average. Sweet tea is just right: not too sweet.\nService is good.   I gave the atmosphere a 4 simply because it is so open and not warm and cozy.  But the chairs are comfortable and not just metal.  So that is a plus.\n\nI spent extra money because I wanted pizza for later.  I‚Äôd say their prices are about what lunch would cost for one person at most tip paying restaurants.",

It was fresh, and had incredible flavor. The cheese bread also comes with marinara dipping sauce.\n\nThe main reason I had issues enjoying the food is the pizza. The crust was not crispy but, it was dry enough. I could tell the cheese was also dried out. Maybe if the crust was flavored, it may have been enjoyable somewhat but, this was not the case. I just feel the pizza may have been re-baked one too many times.\n\nI will try them again cause if the cheese bread can taste the way it did, then the pizza can be good too.\n\nI really want to like this place since it is pretty close to my home and there are not many non-chain restaurants to choose from  so, will see in the future.",

Josie‚Äôs is a big high on the price of their pies and extremely overpriced on the large Caesar‚Äôs salad. When we mentioned the portion size for two at $10 was small the manager said ‚Äúwell, normally it‚Äôs a bit bigger‚Äù. REALLY, that‚Äôs what you say to your customers?? She proactively took it back but maybe added 2 Tablespoons of romaine to the salad. B\n\nManager tried to make everything right but we could tell they were happy to get rid of us seniors. I assumed they knew we would never be back so wrote us off. In the restaurant industry that‚Äôs a mistake as we live in a large senior community. The other servers were ok but seemed poorly trained.. No atmosphere. You could use a few cheery pictures on the wall. Very plain tables spaced apart.\n\nIn summary, this chain isn‚Äôt seeking out  the senior population but will probably be fine with the younger population of commuters as Swigs is around the corner",
