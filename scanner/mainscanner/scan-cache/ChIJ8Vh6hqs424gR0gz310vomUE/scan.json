The Bolognese Rigatoni was phenomenal as was the focaccia and meatball appetizer. The House Chianti was a generous pour and from a good winery. The only qualm we had with the meal was the short rib lasagna which was lacking about in quantity of the noodles and they were overdone. If there were a few more and they were al dente it would have been amazing as the flavor was great. Will be back again though.",

Service can be spotty, depending on who you get. The house wine wasn't great, a little harsh. Amongst all the apps and entrees we ordered, the single best dish was the Caesar salad. Fresh and crunchy with not too much dressing and pleasant citrus notes. Entrees were somewhat disappointing. Just ok, not incredibly flavorful. At one point we could smell very burnt pizza, perhaps when the cook forgot that he had one in the oven. Decent place, and nice to support the family owners, but none of us is desperate to return.",

Atmosphere is quaint, home style, very welcoming. Our server Hudson, was very friendly, and well informed of the menu. From the beginning, the bread was so good that we decided some of it needed to come home with us. No exaggeration, the sauce, meatballs were perhaps the best that I have ever had. My girlfriend had chicken parm, and she said it was a definitive 10/10. I have zero idea why this hidden jewel, has a 4.5/5 rating, it should definitely be a 5/5.

          "text": "Second time here and had a fantastic dinner. Service was great and the atmosphere kind reminded me of an enoteca in Italy. The Bolognese Rigatoni was phenomenal as was the focaccia and meatball appetizer. The House Chianti was a generous pour and from a good winery. The only qualm we had with the meal was the short rib lasagna which was lacking about in quantity of the noodles and they were overdone. If there were a few more and they were al dente it would have been amazing as the flavor was great. Will be back again though.",

          "text": "This is the first pizza place in Cape Coral that I have been to, that has any air in the pizza crust (!)- which is proper in my book. There are places in downtown Cape that take a rolling pin to their pizza dough... for real!\nAs it was my first visit, I ordered the Margerita, because in its simplicity there is nowhere to hide. We all noticed they use good mozarella, and while my friend enjoyed the marinara sauce, I prefer the pizza sauce just simply marzano tomato based. The dough was nice and chewy. Strangely enough the air was only in the outer part of the crust.\nMy arugula salad was ok, if uninspired with some very fibery bits of canned artichoke. The ceasar was much appeciated by my friends.\nThe wine list is very Costco, not the most interesting, but we found a nice bottle of red to share.\nWe liked the cozy look of the place and the singer, who had a beautiful voice and sang at a pleasant volume that made table conversation possible. The service was correct but we found it a bit lacking in warmth.\nAt a place like this one hopes for an offer of limoncello to conclude the meal, but only the check arrived.\nI feel that with some tweaks this place could become a favorite.",

Tried the Wild Mushroom Arancini which was amazing and the Gnocchi Primavera was so fluffy it was like eating marshmallows. The sauce was so rich full of flavor and the olives and artichoke added a nice balance with pops of flavor. Amazingly good!",

Service can be spotty, depending on who you get. The house wine wasn't great, a little harsh. Amongst all the apps and entrees we ordered, the single best dish was the Caesar salad. Fresh and crunchy with not too much dressing and pleasant citrus notes. Entrees were somewhat disappointing. Just ok, not incredibly flavorful. At one point we could smell very burnt pizza, perhaps when the cook forgot that he had one in the oven. Decent place, and nice to support the family owners, but none of us is desperate to return.",

After you put the food request in it will take 1 hour for the food to come out.  In the meantime, no one comes out to tell you that the food is on its way or taking long. The only reason you would know is if after 45 minutes you ask what is going on with the food order. No attempt is made to explain the situation.\nThe food itself is nothing special that would make it worth the wait or make you want to come back to the restaurant.",

Online I had seen 3 or 4 dishes that looked fantastic but none were available on new menu. The attitude of the server quickly changed from pleasant to ho-hum when we she eagerly told about the alcohol selection, which we were not interested in. The bread was stale like it had been sitting for a while. The portions were tiny for the price. (Avg $25-30) per plate.",

Now, if you like New York pizza, be aware that the pizza here is from Napolitano, and don‚Äôt expect crispy pizza. I had the veal, and it was delicious. Not enough to take home, but enough to get a full stomach. I hope you enjoy it, just like I did!",

There are places in downtown Cape that take a rolling pin to their pizza dough... for real!\nAs it was my first visit, I ordered the Margerita, because in its simplicity there is nowhere to hide. We all noticed they use good mozarella, and while my friend enjoyed the marinara sauce, I prefer the pizza sauce just simply marzano tomato based. The dough was nice and chewy. Strangely enough the air was only in the outer part of the crust.\nMy arugula salad was ok, if uninspired with some very fibery bits of canned artichoke. The ceasar was much appeciated by my friends.\nThe wine list is very Costco, not the most interesting, but we found a nice bottle of red to share.\nWe liked the cozy look of the place and the singer, who had a beautiful voice and sang at a pleasant volume that made table conversation possible. The service was correct but we found it a bit lacking in warmth.\nAt a place like this one hopes for an offer of limoncello to conclude the meal, but only the check arrived.\nI feel that with some tweaks this place could become a favorite.",

Service can be spotty, depending on who you get. The house wine wasn't great, a little harsh. Amongst all the apps and entrees we ordered, the single best dish was the Caesar salad. Fresh and crunchy with not too much dressing and pleasant citrus notes. Entrees were somewhat disappointing. Just ok, not incredibly flavorful. At one point we could smell very burnt pizza, perhaps when the cook forgot that he had one in the oven. Decent place, and nice to support the family owners, but none of us is desperate to return.",

Well I was shocked  you can't get a pizza your way and the one we got was all burnt around the edges.  Our server was good she was very attentive but we will never go back.  Can't believe they would serve a pizza like this",

After you put the food request in it will take 1 hour for the food to come out.  In the meantime, no one comes out to tell you that the food is on its way or taking long. The only reason you would know is if after 45 minutes you ask what is going on with the food order. No attempt is made to explain the situation.\nThe food itself is nothing special that would make it worth the wait or make you want to come back to the restaurant.",
