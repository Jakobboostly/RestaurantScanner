The \"extra large\" pizza is smaller than anywhere else. The pizza had very little sauce, was given to me cold, and the dough is clearly not made fresh at all. Frozen pizzas from a grocery store are of better quality than this place.\n\nSave your money and avoid this place. I wish I did, I would've saved $36!",

The toppings were sparse, with almost no cheese or sauce. Additionally, the store was noticeably dirty, reflecting poorly on the management.

I would really like to see seasoning make its way to one of these pies. I mean honestly you could buy pizza from Costco and get a better quality food for cheaper! I mean if you are not going to be about quality then please quit price gouging customers. If you are going to be about quality then quit using cheap ingredients. For the price charged that should have been the best pizza I ever ate! I also want to talk about on atmosphere and feel that your restaurant is rather uninspiring and seems to lack any kind of identity. What differentiates you from any other small pizza hole in the wall? Nothing, in my opinion. Oh and none of your employees look like they want to be there.

It was made of rubber, super chewy, no flavor, hardly any toppings, hard to tear apart, I mean, we've gotten better pizza from the frozen section.  They say, you get what you pay for but in this case, the quality does NOT match the price. I normally don't leave reviews but it was THAT BAD!",

Best pizza, not greasy & a great salad. We live in Providence so it‚Äôs really close. We live here seasonally but my brother in law lives here so passed the word to him. Hope you stay successful & look forward to returning in the Spring. Plan on this being our pizza restaurant of choice!! Thank you!",

It's basically a quesadilla under your pizza. It sounds good on paper but the end result for an extra $6 is disappointing. Maybe you'll like but we didn't. Will be back for the double Pepperoni! Amazing!\n\nResponse: it's just melted but 'uncooked' cheese. Maybe need to melt the cheese on a griddle or skillet and then transfer it to the cheese crust?",

The toppings were sparse, with almost no cheese or sauce. Additionally, the store was noticeably dirty, reflecting poorly on the management.
