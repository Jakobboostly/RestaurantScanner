Which was fine since we were a large party.\nAs soon as you walk in, there's two kiosks you can place your order at or if you'd rather, go further into the restaurant and place your order with someone.\nYou look at the menu and prices and wonder how can you get full off off 2 tacos and a side and make it worth it? These aren't your fast food tacos. These are much more than just a shell, meat, lettuce, and cheese.\nEveryone got different items off the menu and everyone enjoyed their meals.\nI personally got the 2 taco platter which came with a side of choice which I picked the tots. I left satisfied. I got the Korean BBQ pork and Cascabel Chili Chicken. Both were amazing and highly recommend. The tots were topped with sauce and other goodies.\nI didn't get pictures of the menus but it's completely different from the pictures I can see online and the link to the menu is an old one.\nI would come back again if I'm in the area.",

The prices seem reasonable. I was disappointed they didn't have condiments (hot sauces, salt & pepper packets, ect) to go along with the meal.\nOverall, this restaurant wasn't the best place I've ever tried.",

I order from here at least once every other week and haven't really had a problem. Our company has used their catering service a few times and they always arrive on time and the order is correct. Their set up is as good, if not better, as Cafe Rio or Costa Vida. I highly recommend and will continue to order from them and use their services for catering in the future!",

Which was fine since we were a large party.\nAs soon as you walk in, there's two kiosks you can place your order at or if you'd rather, go further into the restaurant and place your order with someone.\nYou look at the menu and prices and wonder how can you get full off off 2 tacos and a side and make it worth it? These aren't your fast food tacos. These are much more than just a shell, meat, lettuce, and cheese.\nEveryone got different items off the menu and everyone enjoyed their meals.\nI personally got the 2 taco platter which came with a side of choice which I picked the tots. I left satisfied. I got the Korean BBQ pork and Cascabel Chili Chicken. Both were amazing and highly recommend. The tots were topped with sauce and other goodies.\nI didn't get pictures of the menus but it's completely different from the pictures I can see online and the link to the menu is an old one.\nI would come back again if I'm in the area.",

They brought each person in our groups food out separately with 5-10 minutes between each one. So we basically all ate at different times. Then they forgot the rest of our meals and forgot to bring us several items after waiting about 10-15 minutes. Other people who had just sat down were getting their food before us, and we had been waiting forever. So some people in our group went without having any food. Horrible experience. Will not be returning. It‚Äôs unfortunate because we used to love this place.",

The chips are fried wantons, the mock Kimchi substitutes for cheese, and there's a heat that catches you off guard in the opening bites, but finishes smooth as I found myself scraping the bottom of the dish for the final morsels.\n\nThe tots are crisp, but be prepared for the Buffalo vinegarette sauce. The bottom tots get saturated by the sauce, there may be a benefit to ordering sauce on the side to keep the tot crisp until the last tots.\n\nThe taco experience was neutral as Korean BBQ taco comes with kimchi and onion, that my wife doesn't like, so there wasn't much left on the taco. The second taco was the old skool steak asada and she really liked the flavors.\n\nMalasada are best enjoyed warm, but dipping the donut into the gooey agave glaze requires some engineering to clear a spot for dipping. We both agree a scoop of vanilla ice cream would take this dish to the next level. By itself, still has Great flavor!\n\nOverall a new and interesting experience that may not be for everyone, but I enjoyed our visit tonight.",

I used to come here for lunch at least once a week ever since they got rid of the line and make you order at the kiosk the quality has gone way downhill, so has the customer service. I used to like to add onions to one of my rice bowls, but now it‚Äôs so difficult to customize from the kiosk that it‚Äôs not worth going anymore. Their sign says if you don‚Äôt want to use the kiosk you can walk around the corner and they have a cashier available but when you try to order with the cashier they tell you you have to use the kiosk or pay cash because they don‚Äôt really want you to order there. I miss the days when you could walk down the line and tell them what you wanted on your rice bowl. Used to be fantastic. I don‚Äôt go here anymore. I tried it tonight just to see if maybe things had changed but they haven‚Äôt. Not only that usually when you order a Not only that usually when you order an old-school Asada steak bowl it‚Äôs got lots of steak ‚Äî tonight I had about four little strips. Such poor quality now. This place is a ‚Äúskip‚Äù for me now now. One star. Pass.",

I believe there is new ownership now and the quality control has just tanked recently.\n\nWhen this food is cooked correctly there is nothing better but for the past several months the rice is always way over cooked (it‚Äôs like eating mush not fluffy white rice), and it tastes like the chicken is days old (I ordered two tacos today and couldn‚Äôt even finish them the meat was so tough and over cooked). I just threw away my meal and went to Chipotle for dinner.\n\nIf this was a one time thing I wouldn‚Äôt be leaving a review but I loved this place so much and now the quality is just awful. My wife ordered a steak salad and the lettuce was browning, the meat was again over cooked, and the whole meal was just subpar.\n\nStill can‚Äôt believe this happened to my favorite restaurant! Used to go here once a week for years dangit :-).",

I asked them to remake it and they clearly just took the lettuce off the top and replaced it but there‚Äôs still cheese all over the chicken. Super disappointing since I drove 30 minutes just to order from them. Wasted money & time!",

They brought each person in our groups food out separately with 5-10 minutes between each one. So we basically all ate at different times. Then they forgot the rest of our meals and forgot to bring us several items after waiting about 10-15 minutes. Other people who had just sat down were getting their food before us, and we had been waiting forever. So some people in our group went without having any food. Horrible experience. Will not be returning. It‚Äôs unfortunate because we used to love this place.",
