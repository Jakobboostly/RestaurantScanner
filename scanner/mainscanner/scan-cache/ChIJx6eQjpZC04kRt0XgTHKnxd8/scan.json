          "text": "It was Saturday night in the psych ward at Niagara Regional Hospital. I had begged to be taken to a Catholic Hospital and when I tried to bolt thats when protocol dictated that I needed to be in my room under guard. They sent the nicest guards to sit at the door who didnt rat me out when I spit out the medicine that I cheeked. I took the Risportal bec for a short period of time it doesnt really affect you but i spit out the benzo. If im gonna die might as well be Big Pharma. Maybe a white van will pull up and they'll throw me in and take me finally to College Hospital. But back to Niagara Memorial Hospital they were so nice. Now dont get me wrong they were super nice to me at two of the psych wards in Monmouth County. I never had the chance to try out Red Bank where my sister works but I did try out Long Branch and I also tried out Neptune. Neptune psych is unbelievable Monmouth psych wasnt as clean and i wasnt that crazy about the food. I mean I was crazy, and the food made me crazier but I wasn't crazy in the colloquial usage of that word. My thoughts often wander back to that Saturday night at Niagara Memorial Hospital. The kindest guard walked me down the hallway. He said surprise once a week they bring in pizza. From where, I asked. From Frenchie's. Not just pizza but also wings. That pizza and wing combo that Saturday night was m'ayn oilum habuh. However something I learned from MCCI is that when somebody is in crisis you dont serve them chicken on a bone because God forbid they can choke on it. Wednesday was chicken dinner at MCCI. I nearly fought a boy who took my chicken thats how good that chicken tasted. I love Calvin who ran the MCCI kitchen. I owe everything to Sergeant Scalese who got me a job in the kitchen. A black apron meant you worked in the officer's dining room. On Tuesday and Friday they baked fres pizza to the officer's. Leftovers were given to the kitchen staff. The MCCI kitchen will always be my favorite kitchen and maybe one day I'll be a kitchen tech there. Shout out to Higgins :)",

It was so inedible and they forgot my 4 cups of bbq which i was charged for and the delivery kid said was IN the box. Called store and snotty female manager said she made it and dumped the extra sauce from the bowl ontop of the pizza after shaking the fingers. I said I wanted a refund and to come get it bc I tried to eat it and couldn't. I ate less than a slice and my husband did the same. And told the manager it was missing. The delivery kid came and tried to say he wasn't giving me the money back bc pizza was missing and ended in me calling the manager back and getting into a screaming match over them trying to not give me the money even though she was aware that 2 pieces were bitten into and missing BEFORE she offered to refund it. Horrible customer service. Horrible food. Idk what MANAGER pours this much wet sauce on top of pizza. Save your money!!!!",

          "text": "It was Saturday night in the psych ward at Niagara Regional Hospital. I had begged to be taken to a Catholic Hospital and when I tried to bolt thats when protocol dictated that I needed to be in my room under guard. They sent the nicest guards to sit at the door who didnt rat me out when I spit out the medicine that I cheeked. I took the Risportal bec for a short period of time it doesnt really affect you but i spit out the benzo. If im gonna die might as well be Big Pharma. Maybe a white van will pull up and they'll throw me in and take me finally to College Hospital. But back to Niagara Memorial Hospital they were so nice. Now dont get me wrong they were super nice to me at two of the psych wards in Monmouth County. I never had the chance to try out Red Bank where my sister works but I did try out Long Branch and I also tried out Neptune. Neptune psych is unbelievable Monmouth psych wasnt as clean and i wasnt that crazy about the food. I mean I was crazy, and the food made me crazier but I wasn't crazy in the colloquial usage of that word. My thoughts often wander back to that Saturday night at Niagara Memorial Hospital. The kindest guard walked me down the hallway. He said surprise once a week they bring in pizza. From where, I asked. From Frenchie's. Not just pizza but also wings. That pizza and wing combo that Saturday night was m'ayn oilum habuh. However something I learned from MCCI is that when somebody is in crisis you dont serve them chicken on a bone because God forbid they can choke on it. Wednesday was chicken dinner at MCCI. I nearly fought a boy who took my chicken thats how good that chicken tasted. I love Calvin who ran the MCCI kitchen. I owe everything to Sergeant Scalese who got me a job in the kitchen. A black apron meant you worked in the officer's dining room. On Tuesday and Friday they baked fres pizza to the officer's. Leftovers were given to the kitchen staff. The MCCI kitchen will always be my favorite kitchen and maybe one day I'll be a kitchen tech there. Shout out to Higgins :)",

Completely soaked in Grease and tastes like a pizza that was made yesterday and reheated really disappointed because they were one of the only places left with good slices but looks like i lll have to find another go to as this place just isnt worth paying 2.50 a slice for grease pooled on flat dough.

It was so inedible and they forgot my 4 cups of bbq which i was charged for and the delivery kid said was IN the box. Called store and snotty female manager said she made it and dumped the extra sauce from the bowl ontop of the pizza after shaking the fingers. I said I wanted a refund and to come get it bc I tried to eat it and couldn't. I ate less than a slice and my husband did the same. And told the manager it was missing. The delivery kid came and tried to say he wasn't giving me the money back bc pizza was missing and ended in me calling the manager back and getting into a screaming match over them trying to not give me the money even though she was aware that 2 pieces were bitten into and missing BEFORE she offered to refund it. Horrible customer service. Horrible food. Idk what MANAGER pours this much wet sauce on top of pizza. Save your money!!!!",
