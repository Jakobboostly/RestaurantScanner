Our server was nice, friendly, but seemed to be a little bit in a rush to get us out of there and did not get our drink orders 100% correct the first time around. We ordered a cappuccino and it came on a tumbler glass, warm, not hot. We ordered a few dishes and a couple were in good portion size but the lasagna was really small.  Some of our dishes came barely warm and got cold really quick. Atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice. They actually had banquet rooms with wedding and birthday parties. Overall, it was a little pricey for the quantity and quality of the food.",

The cheese on the pizza is SO thick and stringy my kids couldn't eat it. It wasn't cut well, we asked to use a pizza cutter and were told it wasn't possible to use one..., the knives we had were serrated for steak and do not cut pizza well whatsoever. They gave our  young child a sprite in a normal tall adult size heavy glass and didn't have small kid cups with lids ?

The cheese on the pizza is SO thick and stringy my kids couldn't eat it. It wasn't cut well, we asked to use a pizza cutter and were told it wasn't possible to use one..., the knives we had were serrated for steak and do not cut pizza well whatsoever. They gave our  young child a sprite in a normal tall adult size heavy glass and didn't have small kid cups with lids ? Not impressed with the food, it was a Sunday so maybe it's just the day and time",

          "text": "We hosted a baby shower at Sam‚Äôs on Riverside the Saturday before Easter.\nEverything was remarkable. The room was set up very nicely (there was even a beautiful window in the room!). The service was efficient and prompt. The pizza, pasta, salad,  and fruit were delicious. There were no surprise charges or fees. I would definitely book another celebration at Sam‚Äôs. We were very pleased. Our guests were all impressed with Sam‚Äôs also! Five stars!!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",

We sat at the bar for about 15 or 20 minutes. They were terribly understaffed. I saw one waitress in the dining room and a waiter/ bartender in the bar area. There may have been more wait staff but I didn't see them. No one looked at us nor talked to us. Never got seated and were completely ignored. We left. I think the waiter/ bartender wanted us to.

It wasn't cut well, we asked to use a pizza cutter and were told it wasn't possible to use one..., the knives we had were serrated for steak and do not cut pizza well whatsoever. They gave our  young child a sprite in a normal tall adult size heavy glass and didn't have small kid cups with lids ?
