Mavia was so wonderful to work with from planning through the end of the shower and the staff was very friendly and helpful as well. They even brought out a cart to our cars and helped us unload all the things for the shower. Julie, the owner, was so friendly and did an amazing job on the charcuterie board we ordered. It looked fabulous. The turkey bacon BLT‚Äôs were delicious as was the Caesar salad we had. Thank you Mavia, Julie and Cleats staff. I would highly recommend Cleats.",

I arrived to pick up my order and unfortunately they were out of tenderloin and were not able to make my sliders :( I had a very pleasant encounter with the staff who offered me a new item on the house. I was very appreciative. Regardless whether you get the sliders, pulled pork, or another menu item, it will taste great.",

Mavia was so wonderful to work with from planning through the end of the shower and the staff was very friendly and helpful as well. They even brought out a cart to our cars and helped us unload all the things for the shower. Julie, the owner, was so friendly and did an amazing job on the charcuterie board we ordered. It looked fabulous. The turkey bacon BLT‚Äôs were delicious as was the Caesar salad we had. Thank you Mavia, Julie and Cleats staff. I would highly recommend Cleats.",

          "text": "We are newer to this area and 3 weeks before graduation decided to throw a party for our daughter.  One of my friends suggested Cleats Bar & Grille based on another Grad Party she had been there for.  I called the owner, Julie, on a Monday morning.  She met me that evening at Cleats to show me around and let me sample food, and by the next morning we had a date on the calendar and a menu set.  I couldn't believe we were able to book the party the weekend of graduation when all of our family was in town!  Julie was so knowledgable after having thrown graduation parties for her own children and multiple events every weekend at Cleats.  She also has a high expectation for everything she and her staff prepare for their customers.  Throughout the preparation process, Julie was easy to reach, gave great suggestions backed up by pictures, was conscious of our budget, and even met me again when she knew I wanted to go over-the-top with the decorations.  As we got closer to the day of the party, Mavia became my point person.  The day of, I was able to come early to set up and Mavia was there to ask questions, give suggestions, and help all while running another event.  When we had stronger than normal wind, nothing was holding and I was out of time, Mavia had the entire staff step in and move part of our setup indoors (special circumstances) while I went home to get ready.  When I got back, Mavia and the staff had everything in place, were waiting for other family members for the rest of our setup and had the entire place looking like it was meant to be that way all along.   The food was such a hit, that we ran out quickly, but not to worry because Julie has done this long enough that she was prepared and we were able to provide our guests food the entire night.  In the end, my daughter was thrilled with the outcome, I was oh, so grateful, because I knew what it took to pull it all off, and we are still getting compliments and being told by friends they are looking at Cleats to hold their children's Grad parties!\nWHY CHOOSE CLEATS BAR & GRILLE FOR YOUR EVENT?  Great Communication, Good Food & Beverages (Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic), Awesome Venue with Beach Volleyball, Cornhole sets, ability to play your own music, videos and karaoke, Beautiful Sunset Views, Reasonably Priced, No mess to clean up at Home, and a Knowledgeable, Flexible and Caring Staff that does whatever they can to make sure you and your guests are happy.\nI cannot recommend this place enough and my youngest has already asked to hold her Grad Party at Cleats in 2 years.",
