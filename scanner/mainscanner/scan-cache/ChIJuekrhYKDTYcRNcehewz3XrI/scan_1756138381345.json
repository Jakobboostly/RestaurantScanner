A good variety of hamburger, I tried the Johnny and the Outlaw the last being my favorite, Johnny was great but too many flavors took away the rib eye flavor which is what I wanted to try. Overall a great experience and will definitely come again.",

I ordered the Johnny burger with house fries.  They asked how I wanted the egg fried, which impressed me.  Not many places care enough to do that.  I chose over easy, which is not an easy way to prepare an egg and it came out perfectly.  The beef patty was so juicy and flavorful, and obviously not some pre-formed frozen patty.  The burger was a delicious mix of sweet, spicy, and savory, and I gobbled it down so fast I barely took a breath.  The burger was a good size, and the fries were an ample amount.  The fries are delicious.  They are the perfect balance of crispy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside.  The fry sauce is a little sweet and a little spicy.  I really liked it, but some may find it too different from typical fry sauce.  They have a cute little patio space with 6 or 7 two-top tables.  Pets are welcome on the patio for all the fur parents out there.  I highly recommend this place.  I'm excited to go back and try their other burgers.",

We had to get fries of course. They were perfectly crispy and soft in the middle with some amazing dipping sauces on the side.

I got the Johnny (so so yummy) and my boyfriend chose the chef‚Äôs special, which to be honest sounded a little funky at first because it had peanut butter and jelly on it, but turned out to be amazing! We had to get fries of course. They were perfectly crispy and soft in the middle with some amazing dipping sauces on the side. The cashier was also super friendly and gave us a little run down since it was our first time in which was very nice :)",

I ordered the Johnny burger with house fries.  They asked how I wanted the egg fried, which impressed me.  Not many places care enough to do that.  I chose over easy, which is not an easy way to prepare an egg and it came out perfectly.  The beef patty was so juicy and flavorful, and obviously not some pre-formed frozen patty.  The burger was a delicious mix of sweet, spicy, and savory, and I gobbled it down so fast I barely took a breath.  The burger was a good size, and the fries were an ample amount.  The fries are delicious.  They are the perfect balance of crispy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside.  The fry sauce is a little sweet and a little spicy.  I really liked it, but some may find it too different from typical fry sauce.  They have a cute little patio space with 6 or 7 two-top tables.  Pets are welcome on the patio for all the fur parents out there.  I highly recommend this place.  I'm excited to go back and try their other burgers.",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm welcome and an inviting atmosphere that set the stage for an amazing dining experience.\n\nThe burgers? Phenomenal! Perfectly cooked, packed with flavor, and served with fresh, high-quality ingredients that make every bite memorable. Whether you're a classic cheeseburger fan or looking for something more adventurous, they‚Äôve got options that hit the spot. And let's talk about the fries‚Äîcrispy, golden perfection that pairs beautifully with their selection of sauces.\n\nThe service was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and genuinely cared about making sure every guest had an exceptional experience. My order was taken promptly, the food arrived fresh and hot, and the entire experience felt effortless.\n\nBurgers and Barley is the kind of place that keeps you coming back, whether for a casual night out or a meal that satisfies every craving.",

And since I can't have bread currently, (though their buns are flipping delicious)they have a fabulous lettuce wrap, and you can also have gluten free options. Amazing.\n\nHave I mentioned their fries? What the heck?! How can fries be so good!! Love love love. We even tried their chocolate Oreo shake... And yes, perfection. What else would you expect? I love that it wasn't ginormous, too! Perfect little dessert.\n\nYou can watch sports while you eat, and the owner comes out and talks to you personally and asks how things are. Very kind, generous and an amazing cook. Love that personal touch. Go go go!!\n\nI meant to take pictures but the good was so dang good I forgot! Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\nOh and apparently they have great draft beers? I wouldn't know since I don't drink, but it's in their name, so yeah. Ha",
