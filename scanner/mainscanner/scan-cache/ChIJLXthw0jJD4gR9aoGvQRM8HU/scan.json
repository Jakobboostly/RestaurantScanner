It was busy, so I get where they are coming from. After waiting a long time, I was told they don‚Äôt even have tofu. So I left.\n\nHere‚Äôs my thing, make it clear for customers. It‚Äôs 2025! Have a clear and labeled menu- some of us don‚Äôt want to eat dead animals or consume breast milk of another animal. Even the bean burger was on a butter bun. The menu in the restaurant said you could add protein, but didn‚Äôt say what kind of protein was available, the QR code on the menu to ‚Äúshow the full menu‚Äù also didn‚Äôt say what kind of protein you could add. The website did, but apparently there‚Äôs no tofu. Bring back the tofu!",

Drinks are brought promptly. Food is served within reasonable time. The servers come to check on the food quality  and to check for additional drinks! The Buffalo wings are hit with my son. My favorites are shrimp, chicken salad, and waffle fries. They are delivered well cooked and good presentation.  They are very family oriented. I never have to wait more than 10 seconds to be acknowledged and seated. They allow me to get the same table for my son if it's not taken because he  is disabled and prefers sameness. I love the atmosphere on Bingo night! A member of my community recommended this llace as friendly, good drinks and reasonable prices.  The establishment is clean and decorated differently each holiday or season. I could go on and on!",

I've been a loyal customer since before the pandemic and they treat us with such carelessness.  The neighborhood people are what kept them alive through the pandemic and they treat us this way.

It was busy, so I get where they are coming from. After waiting a long time, I was told they don‚Äôt even have tofu. So I left.\n\nHere‚Äôs my thing, make it clear for customers. It‚Äôs 2025! Have a clear and labeled menu- some of us don‚Äôt want to eat dead animals or consume breast milk of another animal. Even the bean burger was on a butter bun. The menu in the restaurant said you could add protein, but didn‚Äôt say what kind of protein was available, the QR code on the menu to ‚Äúshow the full menu‚Äù also didn‚Äôt say what kind of protein you could add. The website did, but apparently there‚Äôs no tofu. Bring back the tofu!",
