It‚Äôs always a clean environment and not too loud, so conversation would be easy.  I usually take orders to go or sit at the wine bar. I just wish they had seating that wasn‚Äôt hard metal chairs. If they did I would stay longer, order more food and bottles of wine and invite a group of people to enjoy a meal with us. In all I definitely will return.",

My favorite is the Spicy Cuppa. It‚Äôs covered in arugula, hiding all the delicious ingredients underneath.\nIl Norcini is great for  meat lovers.\nFor a salad, the Vivino Chopped is an excellent and hardy salad.\nThey also have some great beer and cider on tap.\nService has always been top notch in a very clean environment. If you are by yourself or with one other person, it‚Äôs great to sit at bar and chat with the manager or server. They are good people to talk with.\n\nI highly recommend eating here!",

Honestly, it‚Äôs the best pizza I‚Äôve ever had.\n\nI‚Äôve been coming here biweekly for three months, and every visit delivers the same results: incredible pizza, consistent quality, and friendly service.\n\nTheir red sauce pizzas are a masterclass in craft. The crust is blackened just right in their arch oven, offering structural integrity for a mighty bite while folding effortlessly into your hand like a taco. The ingredients? Always fresh. The meats? Delightfully unique. Forget pepperoni‚Äîthey use house made coppa speck, and it‚Äôs a game-changer.\n\nThe Spicy Coppa pizza: a perfect combination of heat, saltiness, and peppery arugula. The bitter greens balance the rich pork, all elevated by tangy olive oil on a crisp crust. It‚Äôs $20 well spent. Hesitant at first, I trusted the server‚Äôs recommendation, and she nailed it.\n\nFeeling less adventurous? Try the Sausage & Honey pizza. I was skeptical too‚Äîhoney on pizza? After bad experiences at places like Mod, I avoided it. But here? It‚Äôs perfection. The fresh ingredients make all the difference, including the spicy jalape√±os that pack a punch.\n\nTheir meatballs? Next-level. Soft, tender, and bathed in a tomato sauce that feels like a bite of Italian heritage. Don‚Äôt skip them. The server informed me the recipe was over 100 years old and researched to infinity.\n\nI heard the owner trained with Italian chefs who‚Äôve passed down generations of recipes. You can taste the refinement and authenticity in every bite. The photos in the restaurant are taken by the owner in Italy.\n\nService Matters‚Ä®The team at Vicino‚Äôs is cordial, attentive, and reassuring. I once mentioned needing everything spot-on for visiting friends after disappointing meals at ‚Äúpopular‚Äù spots (cold food, stale flavors, hair in the dishes). The server listened with genuine care and ensured everything came out perfect‚Äîand it did.\n\nTry Vicino‚Äôs If You:\n* Can‚Äôt risk a bad meal.\n* Love authentic pizza.\n* Appreciate great cuisine.\n* Want to relax at a restaurant that cares.\n\nVicino‚Äôs isn‚Äôt just a pizza place‚Äîit‚Äôs a taste of heritage",
