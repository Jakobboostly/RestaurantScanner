What pisses me off is whoever took over the scheduling never returned my wife‚Äôs phone calls about perhaps playing sometime down the road. Total lack of courtesy on the part of Trail Rider!!!!! So, not that it will impact their business, but my wife and I won‚Äôt ever be back. And our friends will know why!!!\n***************************\nMy wife, Eileen, and her friend, Dain, play Irish music at Trail Rider every month on a Tuesday night. Just wanted to put that out there, but it doesn‚Äôt affect what I think of the place and the food. Coming from New York way back when (I grew up in Upstate NY‚Ä¶the Adirondacks), I‚Äôm familiar with good NY style pizza. Trail Rider is one of a few in the area that comes the closest to NY pizza. Good selection of beer and the service is very good considering one guy, Kevin, bears the load. He‚Äôs always on the move and does good work considering he‚Äôs by himself. Strong work!! If we lived closer, I‚Äôd be there more frequently. So, good pizza, good beer, good atmosphere, and, of course, good music!!! Give it a try and don‚Äôt be in a hurry. This isn‚Äôt McDonalds or Burger King. Have a seat, enjoy the food/drink, and the music!!! Relax‚Ä¶also, this is a local business, so all the money spent here stays here unlike the chain restaurants.",

Superb job of making this a great place Trail Rider! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº\n\nCirca 2022: Terrible customer service... I'll be going to Rumor for pizza from now on. My 1st time @ trail rider: ; I was ignored at the counter for over 10 minutes when I just needed to pickup an online order placed an hour earlier. 2nd time @ trail rider: manager wouldn‚Äôt sell me a drink 20 MINUTES prior to closing while we waited on the kitchen for two pizzas because it was ‚Äútoo close to closing time‚Äù... I love supporting local businesses but I can‚Äôt imagine ever going back to Trail Rider as they seem to behave towards customers however the mood strikes‚Ä¶ goodbye for good\n\n*** 2024 update:  I really want local businesses to thrive, but it‚Äôs obvious that the responses from the (former?) owner to the lower star reviews are qualified in some shape or form.  My 2 cents: don‚Äôt ruin an apology with an excuse.  I‚Äôve been told by some locals that the owners are going through some rough times.  I hope the future is brighter for both of them, and that Trail Rider turns things around and becomes a valued staple of the East Mountain community.  Good luck Ms. Trail Rider‚ÄîI hope to enjoy your offerings again.",

The Reuben sandwich was also very good, one of the better ones I‚Äôve had in a while.\n\nWe happened to be there on karaoke night, which made the evening especially fun. The whole place has that laid-back, mountain-town feel that really adds to the experience.\n\nThe staff is friendly, welcoming, and clearly working hard to keep up. That said, the service was slow, so be prepared to wait a bit.\n\nThe beer selection is solid, with a good variety to choose from‚Äîdefinitely a highlight.\n\nAs for the interior, it‚Äôs definitely on the rustic side and a bit dated, but it fits the casual vibe of the place. If you're looking for a polished or upscale atmosphere, this probably isn‚Äôt it.\nBut if you want good american pizza, local flavor, and a relaxed night out, Trail Rider hits the spot.",

I have to say their pizza was very good. It‚Äôs definitely not a NY pizza but still it was VERY tasty! I would definitely go back there for pizza. Their wings were amazing! Last time I had wings that good was in downtown Chicago at Giordno‚Äôs, a famous deep dish pizza restaurant. And Trail Rider is not just a pizza place, they had so many different kinds of food to offer. I am very excited to have found a new place to eat and am looking forward to trying different foods they have to offer.",
