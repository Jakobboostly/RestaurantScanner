Our waiter, George, was also incredibly professional.\n\nFor starters, the beef tartare with Corn Truffle and black garlic is excellent. The lamb ragu green tagliolini is cooked perfectly, but the highlight of the meal was definitely the short ribs with barbecue balsamic vinegar sauce and daikon radish slaw. And of course, the Italian ice-cream cart and sorbet is a must-try. They also offer the best bread service in NYC.",
