We brought a huge group in as part of a family reunion and we were all completely floored by the cost to value, quality of ingredients, complex flavors, and the insane crust. This is a hidden gem - don‚Äôt miss it!\n\nThe owner is super friendly and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was exceptional. 10/10 would recommend the Brazilian Pink Lemonade - perfectly tart, feels like a party. But hey if you want basic soda there‚Äôs all the essentials too.\n\nPersonal favorites? The Rocket King is explosive, dynamic, and completely delicious (that lemony arugula on top is *chef‚Äôs kiss*). But I couldn‚Äôt stop eating the Thai; it‚Äôs got this incredible peanut sauce instead of marinara and - hear me out - the toppings are exactly the right size, so for being such a complex slice it held together really well & and each bite was well-balanced. And there‚Äôs free Mike‚Äôs Hot Honey - no extra charge; go to town.\n\nNext time I‚Äôm going to have to try the Infernal Ricotta - it‚Äôs the owner‚Äôs favorite but our group devoured it way too fast to share.\n\nNice location, clean & fast service, and a perfect slice of pizza; couldn‚Äôt be happier with our visit.",

We ordered our food and sat down when our food was ready he brought it out to us and told us to enjoy. We started eating absolutely delicious some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. The next thing I knew he left and came back and brought me a little cake that said happy birthday It was some sort of little strawberry shortcake dessert that he actually left his restaurant to go buy and bring back for me. Super incredible because he didn't have to do that and it totally made my whole entire day. So this place is definitely a 10 out of 10! absolutely amazing.",

Always playing something that just triggers nostalgia. Talking about nostalgia, how about when you take that first bite of the pizza and it makes you feel like you‚Äôre a kid all over again. It makes you feel like you‚Äôre at home having a sleepover with all your friends, your parents bring home a pizza and everyone runs to the table to grab their slice. That‚Äôs the type of joy I get when eating rock and crust  pizza. Rock and Crust  is honestly my favorite pizza place of all times. Please come check it out. You won‚Äôt regret it !",

While ordering my friend said she was buying my dinner because it had been my birthday, and the person taking my order goes it's your birthday and I said it was on Monday and he wished me happy birthday and was very sweet about it. We ordered our food and sat down when our food was ready he brought it out to us and told us to enjoy. We started eating absolutely delicious some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. The next thing I knew he left and came back and brought me a little cake that said happy birthday It was some sort of little strawberry shortcake dessert that he actually left his restaurant to go buy and bring back for me. Super incredible because he didn't have to do that and it totally made my whole entire day. So this place is definitely a 10 out of 10! absolutely amazing.",

Instead of sending me with a sub par pizza he went into overdrive and made me another and i was only very slightly late.(super impressive) Always have problems with other places having things done on time and they did great to try and get our crazy order done. Pizza was great! Great service! Great little spot. Great people! We will be back!  Thanks for feeding a bunch of picky, hungry techs that all said they would be happy to eat there again! Thanks!",

          "text": "I ordered a pizza for delivery, 1/2 sausage, 1/2 BBQ pizza with chicken and mushrooms. $45. I used the preferred online ordering method.\n\n1/2 BBQ Chicken, 1/2 Sausage. That's what was on the menu I ordered from. It's what was on the receipt. It's all I ever saw when ordering online.\n\nBut apparently, I got pineapple on it because that's the \"default BBQ.\" Pineapple. Seriously?\n\nTo make it clear, even that's true, that's not obvious in the \"preferred online delivery method\" set up for ordering online unless you deliberately scroll past the option to go half/half to carefully read the description of what the word \"BBQ\" means specifically at this restaurant.\n\nMore realistically, if you order a half/half, ordering it through their preferred provider displays pineapple as an extra, like you'd expect anywhere else.\n\nI didn't have the option to unselect pineapple to begin with. Even if I knew ahead of time that the BBQ came with pineapple by default, I literally could not unselect that option. It wasn't selected in the first place. So why should I be expected to magically know to go back out of the actual menu item I was trying to order to go find a detailed description of the word BBQ to learn that the store owner thinks \"BBQ\" means Hawaiian. Even knowing this, how do I communicate through the app that I want the pineapple taken off if the option's not selected in the first place?\n\nI tried calling several times to see if I could get the order corrected. No answer.\n\nI literally drove back to explain what happened.\n\nFrom my perspective, all I wanted was a barbecue pizza with chicken and mushrooms like I always get at other pizza places, and that the store must have gotten the order wrong.\n\nSo like a good business man, the owner chose to get into an argument with me when I insisted on keeping the mistake pizza for all the trouble.\n\nIf it's not clear:\n\nOther times I've had this issue, that's the courtesy: the restaurant delivers a replacement for free for the inconvenience. This is true whether it's pizza or not -- if the restaurant makes a mistake, they deliver you the corrected order for free. And the reason is because the customer made a specific, expensive order and it's on the restaurant to get that right. A customer ordering for delivery and paying a premium for it should not have to drive back to your restaurant if there's an issue they need to get corrected.\n\nBut apparently, to this store owner, if a customer drives all the way back to the store because no one would answer the phone, apparently the customer is actually \"taking advantage\" of the store for insisting on keeping the first pizza.\n\nTo the owner directly: if someone thinks your pizza is worth enough to spend the time to drive back to talk to you (undoing the value of getting it delivered), don't spit in their face by telling them \"It's none of the customer's business\" that you don't answer your phone and that \"the customer is taking advantage of you\" by insisting on keeping a pizza you guys are just going to throw away. If you had actually bothered answering your phone, you wouldn't have even had the chance to take it back, and your only option to correct the issue would have been to replace it for free.\n\nWhy should I give it back when\n- I had to go back b/c you won't answer your phone?\n- you made a poor excuse for why you put The Meme Topping‚Ñ¢ on my pizza\n-  the only thing you as the owner can safely do with the old one is throw it away?\n\nIs the only person whose time and money are valuable yours?\n\nBut I guess the owner \"doesn't need customers like me.\" These are all things the owner said to my face.\n\nI'm not a business man, but I think the cost of a lost pizza is not worth ignoring and then directly insulting a customer who just wanted his favorite pizza order at a new place. All I expected was to be able to actually customize my pizza like I can anywhere else. Instead I got told off by some self-important jerk who thinks their customers should have to pay more to beg and grovel for the privilege of having a worse customer experience than dominoes.",

We were not disappointed.\n\nWe got one large and I'm medium with half meat/half chicken bacon ranch/half margarita/half tomato, mushroom and sausage. And then I couldn't resist some cheese bread.\n\nThe pizza was fresh and delicious. It is a thin crust pizza and you can taste the freshness. I was with some family members and tried the hot honey they have on the side.... it was a huge hit!\n\nPizza was good, service was even better. Raul (the owner?) came and greeted us and brought us our üçï. They mixed up which size pizza had which toppings (which wasn't that big of a deal) so Raul made us an extra one to take with us when we left.\n\nWhat was even cooler was my daughter who leaves to Mexico on her mission this week was with us and through talking with Raul we discovered that his sister lives in the area that she is going to serve. It's a big area and has at least three missions in the area. But..... through our conversation we actually found that the town she lives in is within her mission boundaries. My daughter has her name and will be keeping an eye out for her!\n\nAnyway, great lunch experience all the way around.... great food, great service..... we will be back! Thanks Raul!",

And DELICIOUS, cooked to perfection - the gluten free crust was stellar in flavor and texture.\nAtmosphere is incredible - clean and tidy rock n‚Äô roll. Best music playing and vibes are high! The owner is so kind and the service was spectacular.\nSuper clean and cool bathroom! :)\nThis place is a 10/10, definitely stop in for an INCREDIBLE and fun pizza experience!! üôåüèª‚ù§Ô∏è Barely got photos because we dived in so fast!!\nHighly recommend the gluten free crust, pesto w/ chicken, and the chicken bacon ranch! üôåüèª",

We brought a huge group in as part of a family reunion and we were all completely floored by the cost to value, quality of ingredients, complex flavors, and the insane crust. This is a hidden gem - don‚Äôt miss it!\n\nThe owner is super friendly and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was exceptional. 10/10 would recommend the Brazilian Pink Lemonade - perfectly tart, feels like a party. But hey if you want basic soda there‚Äôs all the essentials too.\n\nPersonal favorites? The Rocket King is explosive, dynamic, and completely delicious (that lemony arugula on top is *chef‚Äôs kiss*). But I couldn‚Äôt stop eating the Thai; it‚Äôs got this incredible peanut sauce instead of marinara and - hear me out - the toppings are exactly the right size, so for being such a complex slice it held together really well & and each bite was well-balanced. And there‚Äôs free Mike‚Äôs Hot Honey - no extra charge; go to town.\n\nNext time I‚Äôm going to have to try the Infernal Ricotta - it‚Äôs the owner‚Äôs favorite but our group devoured it way too fast to share.\n\nNice location, clean & fast service, and a perfect slice of pizza; couldn‚Äôt be happier with our visit.",

Really, they earn the name \"Rock & Crust\" because their crust really rocks. It's chewy without being too dense and it's flavorful. The ranch also seems house-made and it's great.\n\nNegatives:\nThat sauce. Like sugar straight to the tongue, it's way too sweet with no other flavor to buoy it up. We got the \"Hot\" pizza, and besides lacking spice of any kind, it had hardly enough cheese to call it a pizza. Essentially, we got great crust with too-sweet marinara sauce and peppers on top. The pepperoni was good when you could find it, but the cheese was non-existent.\n\nOverall, a very meh experience for what I paid. They only have one small party table in a sea of huge ones. The teenage boys working the front argued about who got what drink and which pizza when there were only 3 of us in the store, which was entertaining but a bit pitiful.\nIf they fixed their sauce and actually added ingredients to their pizza, I'd go back for that crust. As it stands, though... mid.",

            "text": "This is a mid pizza. That's just what it is.\n\nPositives:\nThe garlic cheese bread is dang good. It's just cheese, garlic and butter on a pizza crust, but it's awesome. Really, they earn the name \"Rock & Crust\" because their crust really rocks. It's chewy without being too dense and it's flavorful. The ranch also seems house-made and it's great.\n\nNegatives:\nThat sauce. Like sugar straight to the tongue, it's way too sweet with no other flavor to buoy it up. We got the \"Hot\" pizza, and besides lacking spice of any kind, it had hardly enough cheese to call it a pizza. Essentially, we got great crust with too-sweet marinara sauce and peppers on top. The pepperoni was good when you could find it, but the cheese was non-existent.\n\nOverall, a very meh experience for what I paid. They only have one small party table in a sea of huge ones. The teenage boys working the front argued about who got what drink and which pizza when there were only 3 of us in the store, which was entertaining but a bit pitiful.\nIf they fixed their sauce and actually added ingredients to their pizza, I'd go back for that crust. As it stands, though... mid.",

            "text": "I ordered a pizza for delivery, 1/2 sausage, 1/2 BBQ pizza with chicken and mushrooms. $45. I used the preferred online ordering method.\n\n1/2 BBQ Chicken, 1/2 Sausage. That's what was on the menu I ordered from. It's what was on the receipt. It's all I ever saw when ordering online.\n\nBut apparently, I got pineapple on it because that's the \"default BBQ.\" Pineapple. Seriously?\n\nTo make it clear, even that's true, that's not obvious in the \"preferred online delivery method\" set up for ordering online unless you deliberately scroll past the option to go half/half to carefully read the description of what the word \"BBQ\" means specifically at this restaurant.\n\nMore realistically, if you order a half/half, ordering it through their preferred provider displays pineapple as an extra, like you'd expect anywhere else.\n\nI didn't have the option to unselect pineapple to begin with. Even if I knew ahead of time that the BBQ came with pineapple by default, I literally could not unselect that option. It wasn't selected in the first place. So why should I be expected to magically know to go back out of the actual menu item I was trying to order to go find a detailed description of the word BBQ to learn that the store owner thinks \"BBQ\" means Hawaiian. Even knowing this, how do I communicate through the app that I want the pineapple taken off if the option's not selected in the first place?\n\nI tried calling several times to see if I could get the order corrected. No answer.\n\nI literally drove back to explain what happened.\n\nFrom my perspective, all I wanted was a barbecue pizza with chicken and mushrooms like I always get at other pizza places, and that the store must have gotten the order wrong.\n\nSo like a good business man, the owner chose to get into an argument with me when I insisted on keeping the mistake pizza for all the trouble.\n\nIf it's not clear:\n\nOther times I've had this issue, that's the courtesy: the restaurant delivers a replacement for free for the inconvenience. This is true whether it's pizza or not -- if the restaurant makes a mistake, they deliver you the corrected order for free. And the reason is because the customer made a specific, expensive order and it's on the restaurant to get that right. A customer ordering for delivery and paying a premium for it should not have to drive back to your restaurant if there's an issue they need to get corrected.\n\nBut apparently, to this store owner, if a customer drives all the way back to the store because no one would answer the phone, apparently the customer is actually \"taking advantage\" of the store for insisting on keeping the first pizza.\n\nTo the owner directly: if someone thinks your pizza is worth enough to spend the time to drive back to talk to you (undoing the value of getting it delivered), don't spit in their face by telling them \"It's none of the customer's business\" that you don't answer your phone and that \"the customer is taking advantage of you\" by insisting on keeping a pizza you guys are just going to throw away. If you had actually bothered answering your phone, you wouldn't have even had the chance to take it back, and your only option to correct the issue would have been to replace it for free.\n\nWhy should I give it back when\n- I had to go back b/c you won't answer your phone?\n- you made a poor excuse for why you put The Meme Topping‚Ñ¢ on my pizza\n-  the only thing you as the owner can safely do with the old one is throw it away?\n\nIs the only person whose time and money are valuable yours?\n\nBut I guess the owner \"doesn't need customers like me.\" These are all things the owner said to my face.\n\nI'm not a business man, but I think the cost of a lost pizza is not worth ignoring and then directly insulting a customer who just wanted his favorite pizza order at a new place. All I expected was to be able to actually customize my pizza like I can anywhere else. Instead I got told off by some self-important jerk who thinks their customers should have to pay more to beg and grovel for the privilege of having a worse customer experience than dominoes.",
