Properly cooked fries should be lightly crisp, not dripping with oil. A better draining or cooking method is needed to improve both taste and health.",

          "text": "Was very unhappy with our recent visit. Sat in the middle of the restaurant seating away from the bar and there were three TVs playing three different things at very high volume a generally stifling atmosphere all around--maybe the A/C was acting up or the general air quality, hard to say. The pizza I received was very good but the appetizer fries were undercooked and generally unflavorful despite the high prices. The service team were nice enough but there was a generally feeling of...contempt? Disdain? Judgement? Some sort or negative energy that we dared to eat there and treated us with all the kindness gritted teeth could provide. This was not one employee but all we interacted with, although be that due to us or an outside reason is beyond me.\n\nRegardless the general unpleasantness diminished the otherwise great food and represents a decline from the usual quality brickhouse used to offer. Generally mixed about the courtyard changes and feels as if Brickhouse holds some sort of animosity towards their neighbors with how they seem to be actively encroaching on the new business next door when they could have a lovely symbiosis if embraced.\n\nWill update my review next time I come through the area; I hope this is a darkspot in their history and nothing more.\n\nEdit: The very defensive and long winded response from the owner assumes much about my visit, including the date in which we visited. While I am sorry to hear about their difficult July 3rd that was not the day I ate there with my husband, and I can assure you dear owner that where I was sitting--somewhere near the front in the middle of the dining area to the right--had three TVs with their volume all the way up. One or two of them was behind me, or to my left, or maybe to my right!\n\nForgive an old woman for not memorizing the exact layout of your dining space; I do not think it matters. When we were there, there were not many people, but despite my age I can assure you that my hearing is just fine and even so, I had difficulty focusing on the conversation at hand due to the significant noise generated by the many pieces of technology all trying for my attention. This made my experience poor, hence my review.\n\nOn the note of your staff, the day we went there were at least 4 servers working with other customers, and I believe I saw two or three people behind the counter as well. Despite it not being a holiday or all that close to one everyone seemed rather miserable and your response gives me a reason as to why.\n\nThis may surprise you, dear owner, but I do not know the geopolitical situation of the space between your restaurant and the distillery, and am frankly confused as to whether you own the distillery or not due to your response, but your unwelcome snark has lost you the only other star on this review. I am glad you have a good relationship with them however and I concede that my lowly peasantry status had me observe behavior and overhear conversation that indicated otherwise. If there is a law that prevents you from sharing the space, fair enough!\n\nI will leave my previous review up for posterity (originally 2 stars for anyone who cares) but I will not be taking up your offer on meeting you or returning to your establishment again. I would encourage you to take anger management courses and use your time treating your customers and your staff better, instead of writing these petulant responses.\n\nYour pizza is great, but the atmosphere, culture, and personality you cultivate needs more work than money can buy.",

The leftover oil not only affected the texture but also made the fries feel unhealthy, leaving an oily aftertaste and coating on the fingers. Properly cooked fries should be lightly crisp, not dripping with oil. A better draining or cooking method is needed to improve both taste and health.",

She has many health issues and has some restrictions. The restaurant had a total of 6 customers in it because it was only 1230. The young lady that waited on us told us we could not have the drink. My son and I did purchase one because we have no restrictions. We decided we would leave. We had already been waiting at least 30 minutes on our pizza. I told the waitress that I would pay for our drinks and then leave. That really upset her and her attitude was horrible. All she kept saying was ‚Äútake it up with the owner‚Äù. Come to find out our order had not even been started. We offered to pay for our sodas and she said not to worry about it. So we left. I have been eating this pizza for as long as I can remember and would have recommended it to anyone. The young lady did explain the abc policy, we accepted and was just going to leave. However, she had to keep running her mouth and got an attitude. Oh well, there is other places to get a pizza and they have much better prices. I miss the old Pizza House.\n\nI am sure the owner will write back with the same ‚Äúridiculous ‚Äú comments that they did on my son‚Äôs review.",

The vibe is great, the store is clean, the staff is friendly - but at the end of the day, the food has to be exceptional. It unfortunately just isn't anymore. The pizza never has enough toppings to even taste, the crust is charred black and bitter from the wood fire....just not a meal I'm ever going to wish I had again. It's sad, I've been a lifer of the location but I need the food to be good.",

            "text": "Was very unhappy with our recent visit. Sat in the middle of the restaurant seating away from the bar and there were three TVs playing three different things at very high volume a generally stifling atmosphere all around--maybe the A/C was acting up or the general air quality, hard to say. The pizza I received was very good but the appetizer fries were undercooked and generally unflavorful despite the high prices. The service team were nice enough but there was a generally feeling of...contempt? Disdain? Judgement? Some sort or negative energy that we dared to eat there and treated us with all the kindness gritted teeth could provide. This was not one employee but all we interacted with, although be that due to us or an outside reason is beyond me.\n\nRegardless the general unpleasantness diminished the otherwise great food and represents a decline from the usual quality brickhouse used to offer. Generally mixed about the courtyard changes and feels as if Brickhouse holds some sort of animosity towards their neighbors with how they seem to be actively encroaching on the new business next door when they could have a lovely symbiosis if embraced.\n\nWill update my review next time I come through the area; I hope this is a darkspot in their history and nothing more.\n\nEdit: The very defensive and long winded response from the owner assumes much about my visit, including the date in which we visited. While I am sorry to hear about their difficult July 3rd that was not the day I ate there with my husband, and I can assure you dear owner that where I was sitting--somewhere near the front in the middle of the dining area to the right--had three TVs with their volume all the way up. One or two of them was behind me, or to my left, or maybe to my right!\n\nForgive an old woman for not memorizing the exact layout of your dining space; I do not think it matters. When we were there, there were not many people, but despite my age I can assure you that my hearing is just fine and even so, I had difficulty focusing on the conversation at hand due to the significant noise generated by the many pieces of technology all trying for my attention. This made my experience poor, hence my review.\n\nOn the note of your staff, the day we went there were at least 4 servers working with other customers, and I believe I saw two or three people behind the counter as well. Despite it not being a holiday or all that close to one everyone seemed rather miserable and your response gives me a reason as to why.\n\nThis may surprise you, dear owner, but I do not know the geopolitical situation of the space between your restaurant and the distillery, and am frankly confused as to whether you own the distillery or not due to your response, but your unwelcome snark has lost you the only other star on this review. I am glad you have a good relationship with them however and I concede that my lowly peasantry status had me observe behavior and overhear conversation that indicated otherwise. If there is a law that prevents you from sharing the space, fair enough!\n\nI will leave my previous review up for posterity (originally 2 stars for anyone who cares) but I will not be taking up your offer on meeting you or returning to your establishment again. I would encourage you to take anger management courses and use your time treating your customers and your staff better, instead of writing these petulant responses.\n\nYour pizza is great, but the atmosphere, culture, and personality you cultivate needs more work than money can buy.",
