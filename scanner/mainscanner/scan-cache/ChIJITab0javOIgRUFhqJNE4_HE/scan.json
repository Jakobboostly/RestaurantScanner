          "text": "This was our first time getting food from Ronetti's Pizza. I've always heard nothing but good things about their establishment, so I wanted to give them a try. We ordered an XL Ultimate pizza, a large pepperoni & cheese pizza, and a half order of crispy plain wings (wings not pictured). The wings were perfect. I asked for crispy, and they made sure they were. They don't skimp on toppings for the most part, as you can see. My only complaint would be that the cheese seems to be lacking. It's not a big issue at all. I know now to maybe get extra cheese next time. The flavor of the sauce is just right. It's not too sweet, and it's not too bitter. It sits somewhere in the middle. There is a bit of spice. I assume it's the pepperoni that's giving that off. It wasn't overpowering, but if you're sensitive to spicy food, I'd recommend something else topping wise. All in all, we'd gladly order here again!",

We order just about the same items every time. Large pep and mushroom pizza with a Super sub. Both were delicious! Ronettis pizza sauce is a little thick, we love it! Only minor issue was the sausage on the super sub was not chopped very well. There were some really big chunks of it. My hubby loves sausage so I just moved the bigger chunks to his half. My favorite thing is that the orders are correct and ready when they say it will be. We always do pick up though. They started a new text program so by signing up for texts, I received a 20% off coupon which was awesome. In general I would say their prices are comparable to other pizza shops in the area and are fair for the potions you get. Great job Ronettis!",

We order just about the same items every time. Large pep and mushroom pizza with a Super sub. Both were delicious! Ronettis pizza sauce is a little thick, we love it! Only minor issue was the sausage on the super sub was not chopped very well. There were some really big chunks of it. My hubby loves sausage so I just moved the bigger chunks to his half. My favorite thing is that the orders are correct and ready when they say it will be. We always do pick up though. They started a new text program so by signing up for texts, I received a 20% off coupon which was awesome. In general I would say their prices are comparable to other pizza shops in the area and are fair for the potions you get. Great job Ronettis!",

Everything was cooked to perfection, including the breadsticks! The girl who assisted me at checkout was friendly and attentive! While the previous staff member who had caused the issue was still not the best. Overall, you won‚Äôt find better pizza in the area. I‚Äôm willing to drive 35 minutes just to enjoy a meal from here.\n\nRonetties has been my go to pizza for years.  I don‚Äôt know what has happened. Tonight I ordered pizza and when I go to pick it up they had forgot to send the order through (of course they tell me that after I pay) they tell me it will be about 10-15 minutes but they will get it right to me.  15 minutes go by and then I check they say it will be another 10 minutes.  I just ask for a refund because I don‚Äôt have time to wait‚Ä¶two hours go by and they call me!! Saying my card declined and would I like to pay for it now‚Ä¶..I DIDNT GET FOOD! (You can see where it came off and then refunded).  I try to over look ordering breadsticks and they are always burnt. You can definitely tell what kind of service and food you will get (or won‚Äôt get!) by who‚Äôs working and it‚Äôs not worth the risk anymore.  Please get it together because when you have the correct staff working it‚Äôs amazing and worth the drive.",

We ordered an XL Ultimate pizza, a large pepperoni & cheese pizza, and a half order of crispy plain wings (wings not pictured). The wings were perfect. I asked for crispy, and they made sure they were. They don't skimp on toppings for the most part, as you can see. My only complaint would be that the cheese seems to be lacking. It's not a big issue at all. I know now to maybe get extra cheese next time. The flavor of the sauce is just right. It's not too sweet, and it's not too bitter. It sits somewhere in the middle. There is a bit of spice. I assume it's the pepperoni that's giving that off. It wasn't overpowering, but if you're sensitive to spicy food, I'd recommend something else topping wise. All in all, we'd gladly order here again!",

They're using Doordash so it has an $8 fee. They are also charging sales tax on delivery which is absolutely ridiculous. So $10 BEFORE TIP. That was 3 nights ago. This morning we found a random delivery on our doorstep. We called the people to tell them we got their order. They said that the owner yelled at them and that he did not want their business anymore. He is not getting our business anymore either. Horrible in every way.",

Almost like a freezer burnt taste. We ordered a pizza that had jalapenos and there were WAY too many on it. It was so spicy that we were picking them off. If you love a ton of spice, this might be the pizza place for you. I'm a big fan of leftovers, but noone in our party had any desire to take the leftover pizza because it wasn't even good the first time.",

I ordered two with no hot peppers. Which was the first clue I didn‚Äôt want anything spicy. I got them home we realized the sausage was so spicy it was burning our mouths. It was Not in any reviews nor was it on the description of the sandwich. I been around the block a few times I am 60 years old. This was not a case of just my taste buds it was extremely spicy. The ‚ÄúManager‚Äù said and I quote ‚Äúour customers don‚Äôt complain about it‚Äù well I am pretty sure due to location and size it‚Äôs a pretty well known establishment and people probably know the sausage is spicy or it was made extra spicy that day. He absolutely refused to do anything about it. I will NOT support this restaurant at any time in the future. You lost a customer. I will also tell my story any chance I get. You sir have missed an opportunity to make things right. You also need to put that you use homemade spicy sausage on your sandwiches in your description on your menu. I can‚Äôt believe they wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it when I spent 40$ there. Please realize if you have any issues there not willing to work with you in any shape or form.",
