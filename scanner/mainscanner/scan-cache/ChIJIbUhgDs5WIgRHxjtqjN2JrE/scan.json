It definitely won't be our last!\nFirst, the owner will great you and will gladly answer any questions, tell you where the fresh seafood comes from, history of the recipes he uses. I enjoyed the conversation!\nWe started off with the Shem Creek Crab Dip. Very good and a hit of spicy, loved it!\nNext was the Costal Crab & Corn Chowder.   Its very flavorful and a dash of OldBay on top makes it perfect.\nI had the Port Royal Pimento Burger. The pimento cheese was spot on, but honestly the burger patty was just ok. I'll try something else next visit.\nMy girlfriend had the Stone Shrimp Burger. Now this was something special!  You can tell it's loaded with Shrimp and not some sort of bread filler. I definitely recommend this burger.\nThe tater tots seemed to be air fried, and not greasy.\nThey also have Hershey brand ice cream for dessert. We didn't try that though because of the good portions, we were full!\nThat's another reading to come back üòÜ",

It definitely won't be our last!\nFirst, the owner will great you and will gladly answer any questions, tell you where the fresh seafood comes from, history of the recipes he uses. I enjoyed the conversation!\nWe started off with the Shem Creek Crab Dip. Very good and a hit of spicy, loved it!\nNext was the Costal Crab & Corn Chowder.   Its very flavorful and a dash of OldBay on top makes it perfect.\nI had the Port Royal Pimento Burger. The pimento cheese was spot on, but honestly the burger patty was just ok. I'll try something else next visit.\nMy girlfriend had the Stone Shrimp Burger. Now this was something special!  You can tell it's loaded with Shrimp and not some sort of bread filler. I definitely recommend this burger.\nThe tater tots seemed to be air fried, and not greasy.\nThey also have Hershey brand ice cream for dessert. We didn't try that though because of the good portions, we were full!\nThat's another reading to come back üòÜ",
