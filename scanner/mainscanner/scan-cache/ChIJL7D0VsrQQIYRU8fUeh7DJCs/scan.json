Tonight I walk in and instead of the usual cheery employee I deal with, there was someone else.\n\nI was told to wait to order because she had a call on hold, which was fine. I placed my order, and asked if the food would be brought over as it always is and she said ‚Äúno‚Äù. I asked what do you mean, the other employees always do since it is literally a couple doors down and her response with attitude was ‚Äúwell she‚Äôs not working today!‚Äù. The saltiness of her response actually surprised me. I asked her what it would take to get it delivered and she said ‚Äúpay the delivery fee and the driver will bring it‚Äù.\n\nI asked her if the driver was going to drive it two doors over and her response was essentially yes they would. Pretty negative experience in a place that has been overwhelming positive in the past. Never seen this employee before, so will definitely spend my money elsewhere if I see her working again. There‚Äôs plenty of other businesses in this strip that appreciate my business and if I‚Äôm craving pizza I will just order dominos if I see her at the counter.",

          "text": "We regularly order food here while at a shop a few doors down and it is delivered to us no problem. Tonight I walk in and instead of the usual cheery employee I deal with, there was someone else.\n\nI was told to wait to order because she had a call on hold, which was fine. I placed my order, and asked if the food would be brought over as it always is and she said ‚Äúno‚Äù. I asked what do you mean, the other employees always do since it is literally a couple doors down and her response with attitude was ‚Äúwell she‚Äôs not working today!‚Äù. The saltiness of her response actually surprised me. I asked her what it would take to get it delivered and she said ‚Äúpay the delivery fee and the driver will bring it‚Äù.\n\nI asked her if the driver was going to drive it two doors over and her response was essentially yes they would. Pretty negative experience in a place that has been overwhelming positive in the past. Never seen this employee before, so will definitely spend my money elsewhere if I see her working again. There‚Äôs plenty of other businesses in this strip that appreciate my business and if I‚Äôm craving pizza I will just order dominos if I see her at the counter.",

The cheesesticks had 0 crunch factor, and so did the onion rings. It was like a sloppy flour mixture, then lightly fried. The pizza was a delicacy, but I wouldn't go here for anything else.
