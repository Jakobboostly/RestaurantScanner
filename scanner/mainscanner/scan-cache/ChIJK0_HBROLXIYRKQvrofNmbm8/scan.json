Some were good & some not.\nWhenever we go to a new place we tell the employee ‚ÄúThis is our first time here‚Äù usually they are a little nicer & give us a rundown of what they offer. Not this time. The employee seemed to not care. She just said ok & stayed quiet. So we were busy looking around trying to figure out what things were. The sun really comes in & beams down on all the glass making it a little difficult to read some of the signage. I asked a few questions like what was the I-40 & what the prices were. I also asked if they offered other items. We ended up buying a stack of 4 pies to try. After we paid, I saw there were some other items for sale that we would‚Äôve included, but the employee seemed to ring us up so quickly we didn‚Äôt get a chance to add them to the order. I was still looking at other pies while she had wrapped up the 4 & said the total. We were the only customers in there so I was surprised by rush to move us along.\nThe ones we bought included Nanny‚Äôs pecan which was good, but the I-40 was waaaay too sweet, couldn‚Äôt taste anything but sugar. The custard pie was over baked. There‚Äôs definitely better ones on the market. Then we had the lemon. üçã Nice flavor & not too sweet.",
