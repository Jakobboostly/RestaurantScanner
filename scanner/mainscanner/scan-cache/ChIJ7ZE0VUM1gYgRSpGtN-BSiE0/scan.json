I was only in Stark Vegas for a short time but settled on Boardtown after some recommendations.  So glad I did.  The pizza was great!  One of my favorites I've had anywhere in Mississippi and id score it pretty high overall anywhere I've been.  Service was spotty.  Though nothing I would complain about but not compliment either. Atmosphere was a little loud which was understood since it was right near student housing.  But go there for the pizza! Also the fries app were surprisingly good!",

But this was some of the best Neapolitan aesthetic, brick oven I‚Äôve ever had. Perfectly crisp crust, balanced sauce, and fresh toppings‚Ä¶ everything was on point.\n\nThe vibe was great, the staff was incredible , and the quality truly rivals what you‚Äôd find in the Northeast. Honestly, this place deserves national attention‚Ä¶.\n\nBoardtown has officially raised the bar for pizza in Starkville. If you‚Äôre in town, don‚Äôt miss it.",

The tomato sauce on the bikini bottom was flavorless. I love San Marzano tomatoes but there was no other seasoning added. No flavor at all. The ricotta, which is one of my favorite ingredients, was straight ricotta. They make a nice pie and they use good ingredients. But it all lacks flavor. No salt, no nothing. If they could figure that out, it would be amazing pizza. Honestly, for the money go to the cheaper places. This is not it. Maybe a straight pepperoni pizza would be the way to go, hoping the pepperoni adds flavor. We did not finish the pizza.\n\nUpdate: The owner reached out and I do appreciate local businesses. So, I changed my review to four stars for that reason. I am a fan of bold flavors. Maybe that is my downfall. But the White Pizza tasted like nothing but roasted garlic and oil. The ricotta doesn‚Äôt come through at all. And the bikini bottom tastes nothing like a Hawaiian. Crunchy pineapple and jalape√±os. That‚Äôs the whole flavor profile. Nothing worked together on either pizza to build a cohesive and tasty pizza. Maybe I should have had some pints beforehand.",

Great beer selection, in an entertainment district as well. Owners are so wholesome. Lillie our bartender was also so great. Would go back and recommend to anyone going or in the area.",

But this was some of the best Neapolitan aesthetic, brick oven I‚Äôve ever had. Perfectly crisp crust, balanced sauce, and fresh toppings‚Ä¶ everything was on point.\n\nThe vibe was great, the staff was incredible , and the quality truly rivals what you‚Äôd find in the Northeast. Honestly, this place deserves national attention‚Ä¶.\n\nBoardtown has officially raised the bar for pizza in Starkville. If you‚Äôre in town, don‚Äôt miss it.",

I was only in Stark Vegas for a short time but settled on Boardtown after some recommendations.  So glad I did.  The pizza was great!  One of my favorites I've had anywhere in Mississippi and id score it pretty high overall anywhere I've been.  Service was spotty.  Though nothing I would complain about but not compliment either. Atmosphere was a little loud which was understood since it was right near student housing.  But go there for the pizza! Also the fries app were surprisingly good!",

          "text": "We ordered two pizza to go. One was a White Pizza and the other a Bikini Bottom. The pizzas were perfectly cooked. The only issue is there was no flavor. The tomato sauce on the bikini bottom was flavorless. I love San Marzano tomatoes but there was no other seasoning added. No flavor at all. The ricotta, which is one of my favorite ingredients, was straight ricotta. They make a nice pie and they use good ingredients. But it all lacks flavor. No salt, no nothing. If they could figure that out, it would be amazing pizza. Honestly, for the money go to the cheaper places. This is not it. Maybe a straight pepperoni pizza would be the way to go, hoping the pepperoni adds flavor. We did not finish the pizza.\n\nUpdate: The owner reached out and I do appreciate local businesses. So, I changed my review to four stars for that reason. I am a fan of bold flavors. Maybe that is my downfall. But the White Pizza tasted like nothing but roasted garlic and oil. The ricotta doesn‚Äôt come through at all. And the bikini bottom tastes nothing like a Hawaiian. Crunchy pineapple and jalape√±os. That‚Äôs the whole flavor profile. Nothing worked together on either pizza to build a cohesive and tasty pizza. Maybe I should have had some pints beforehand.",

Came by with my 2 kids and she kept them filled with soda & waters while introducing me to my new favorite beer! I‚Äôve been there several times and their pizza is definitely in my personal opinion the best in the state of Mississippi and although we didn‚Äôt eat on this particular visit she made it my favorite visit thus far.",

That‚Äôs great that they keep their equipment clean, however, if there are still patrons eating in the restaurant, the soda fountain should be operational. Also, the bathroom garbage can was emptied and turned upside down, leaving no option but to leave trash on top of the can! We had an order total of $100 but when we asked for a container of ranch, there was a $1.00 surcharge for each. Appetizer and pizza were delivered without any plates, leaving us to ask the disgruntled server for some. We have been to Boardtown about 5 times in the last year, but this will be our last.",

His response yes they are I told him what the website menu price was compared to my bill and you would have thought the world ended. His response, I guess he needs to change it.  He? He who? Then just tossed my card across the bar and walked away. Sorry call me old school but I still expect some sort of customer service.

I then approached the bouncer and asked if the cover was $10 or $5. He said that the price just dropped to $5. I called Boardtown Pizza today, and a lady told me that their cover is typically $5 and that she wasn‚Äôt aware of it ever being $10.

That‚Äôs great that they keep their equipment clean, however, if there are still patrons eating in the restaurant, the soda fountain should be operational. Also, the bathroom garbage can was emptied and turned upside down, leaving no option but to leave trash on top of the can! We had an order total of $100 but when we asked for a container of ranch, there was a $1.00 surcharge for each. Appetizer and pizza were delivered without any plates, leaving us to ask the disgruntled server for some. We have been to Boardtown about 5 times in the last year, but this will be our last.",
