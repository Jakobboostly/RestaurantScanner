Fries are ridiculously small for the price though. Will only come back for pizza but definitely checking orders next time to be sure its correct.",

Right away, I got a nostalgic vibe‚Äîthink classic 80s pizza joint, with lots of tables and a cozy atmosphere. The menu is refreshingly simple, making it easy to decide what to get. They offer four sizes: personal, medium, large, and XL. I went for the XL pepperoni.\n\nThe cook took my order and told me it'd be ready in about 10-15 minutes. I want to point out, don‚Äôt let the empty exterior fool you. While waiting, I watched at least six families come in to pick up their orders in that short time, which speaks volumes about their efficiency. The cooks were on it, and I was in and out in a flash.\n\nNow, onto the pizza. The XL was loaded with pepperoni, and I loved the quirky, uneven cut‚Äîit just felt like they didn't overthink it. The dough was soft, all the way from the tip to the crust, with just the right amount of sweetness. The combination of pepperoni and cheese was perfect‚Äîflavorful and satisfying. If you‚Äôre in the area, I highly recommend stopping by. I‚Äôm definitely coming back to try the Detroit-style pizza next time!",
