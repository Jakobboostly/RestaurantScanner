The entire process from planning my son‚Äôs birthday party to the very end of the event, was more than I could have asked for. Rob was phenomenal to work with- he answered every question thoroughly and in a timely manner, dealt with all of my requests making me feel like family and as if I were no bother at all (especially day of when I bothered him a million times). The staff were kind, polite,  attentive to my guests and great to interact with. The food was amazing as always. When I sent out invites, people were so excited to hear we would be going back to Mimmo‚Äôs and the people who didn‚Äôt pay attention to the invite were texting me day of equally excited, raving about how good the food is! Can‚Äôt thank Rob & the Mimmo‚Äôs team enough for helping make my son‚Äôs birthday party truly perfect!\n\nThe millennial in me would love nice fresh,  light paint so the restaurant decor didn‚Äôt interfere with the party decorations hahaha but we made it work and will do so in the future!",
