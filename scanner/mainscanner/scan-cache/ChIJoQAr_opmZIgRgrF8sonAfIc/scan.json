Whiskey Under the Bridge was such a great twist on a hotty toddy, almost crossed with an old fashioned. We loved it so much.

I‚Äôm so glad we did!! The service was warm and wonderful. The food was unique and so good! Ah, but the drinks!!! Whiskey Under the Bridge was such a great twist on a hotty toddy, almost crossed with an old fashioned. We loved it so much. We also tried a 10 year Pappy for the first time, and it was out of this world. We will definitely come back! The 404 Kitchen is a destination!!",

Most of Nashville‚Äôs nicer restaurant options are all revamped chains or secondary locations of a larger corporate venue. So it‚Äôs super special to have this venue in nashville. The whiskey library and society in Gertie‚Äôs is phenomenal. JOIN and GET YOURSELF A LOCKER!!!  the bar staff is thoughtful, creative and super knowledgeable . Shout out to JOHNNIE! the management team always remembers your name and greets you with sincerity! Shout out to SHIRLEY!!!! the service team is so kind and you really get the best service in town‚Ä¶ RACHEL AND KAHLIL!\n\nThe live music on Wednesday and Thursday nights, the creative themed cocktail menus, the artwork, the vibes‚Ä¶ all amazing.\n\nI love that the whiskey bar is downstairs and restaurant is upstairs- it allows for a good separation between the loud exciting speakeasy and an elevated intimate dinner.\n\nTheir annual DERBY event and WHISKEY PAIRING dinners are amazing also - don‚Äôt miss them",

          "text": "Disappointing Decline at 404 Kitchen\n\nWe‚Äôve visited 404 Kitchen a couple of times before and had fantastic experiences‚Äîthanks in large part to Moses and Colton. Their professionalism, attentiveness, and the quality of service they provided made our meals truly memorable. The food and drinks on those visits were equally impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, our most recent visit was a complete letdown. Neither Moses nor Colton were working, and the difference was immediately noticeable. Service was unorganized and inattentive. Our server had an overwhelming body odor, which made the dining experience uncomfortable. We were served small sodas without any offer of refills, and the food itself was bland and uninspired‚Äînowhere near the level we previously enjoyed.\n\nAdding to the disappointment, a woman who appeared to be in a managerial role was making rounds to other tables, but she completely ignored ours. This was particularly frustrating, as we were hoping to share feedback directly and give the restaurant a chance to address our concerns.\n\nSadly, this visit has caused us to reconsider returning to 404 Kitchen. The inconsistency in service and quality is too significant to overlook, and it‚Äôs unfortunate to see such a promising restaurant falter so dramatically.",

          "text": "We went for Mother's Day brunch with our parents. We've always heard good things about 404 so decided to try it. We had a reservation for 6 and were seated quickly but it went downhill from there. Our server finally greeted us and took our drink order. They came 20 minutes later, cokes coffee and tea nothing from the bar. We were told the cokes were in bottles so no free refills. Weird comment but ok. The cokes came in small glasses and watered down but whatever. Our food took an hour and 15 to come out, we barely saw our server during this time as we all sat with empty drinks and water. When the food finally arrived it was luke warm, obvious it had been prepared and sitting for quite some time. My 84 year old father-in-law ordered the Omelette and never dreamed the peppers in it were jalape√±o peppers. It would have been nice if he was warned. He asked for milk to cool his mouth and it took awhile to come out.\nThere were plenty of people working, they weren't short staffed. We were just trying to figure out what all the staff walking around were doing.\nOur families were happy they had plenty of time to catch up so that was nice, but me and my husband were very disappointed. I was surprised there were no apologies for the wait, service or the food issue. I never write reviews but this was such a terrible experience.\nOn our way out someone commented that Gertie's looked cute. I asked the downstairs hostess what time it opened. She just shrugged her shoulders...summed up our experience pretty well.",

A handful of friends who share a passion for good food and great bourbon, we were excited about the vibrant atmosphere and an impressive bar stocked with an extensive selection of liquors and wines. To say we were not disappointed would be an understatement!\n\nAs bourbon enthusiasts, we were thrilled by the unparalleled bourbon selection‚Äîtruly the best we've ever encountered. Our experience was elevated by the amazing manager, Colton Cayhill, and the attentive wait staff, who went above and beyond to ensure our night was memorable.\n\nThe true star of the evening was the chef, whose culinary artistry was evident in every dish. Each plate was a masterpiece, beautifully presented and crafted with care. The sides were thoughtfully paired with the entrees, enhancing the overall experience without overshadowing the main attractions. The portion sizes were just perfect‚Äînot too little to leave you wanting more, yet not so much that you felt overwhelmed. It was a balanced dining experience that left us completely satisfied.\n\nWe started our culinary journey with a delightful tasting of every appetizer, and the unique catfish bites were hands down our favorite! Their crispy exterior and flavorful filling made them an absolute standout. From crisp Brussels sprouts to fresh oysters and their incredible homemade crackers, each dish was a fantastic introduction to what was to come.\n\nFor our entrees, we savored duck, pork chops, and monkfish. The presentation was both elegant and creative, and as we shared each dish, we found it nearly impossible to choose a favorite. Each plate was spot-on, bursting with unique flavors that left us wanting more.\n\nJust when we thought we couldn't possibly eat another bite, the dessert parade began! We were presented with one of each dessert: bourbon cake, cr√®me br√ªl√©e, blonde brownie, and a distinctive salted ice cream. As bourbon lovers, we were delighted with the expertly paired drinks that complemented each course perfectly.\n\n404 is a gem in the Gulch that we highly recommend for anyone seeking an unforgettable dining experience. From the ambiance to the food and drink selections, everything was top-notch. We can‚Äôt wait to return! Cheers!",

Serving up American/southern elevated cuisine, our experience at 404 Kitchen was fantastic.\n\nA must have is their Tri-trip and the cornbread. Truly amazing.\n\nIf your are a whiskey lover this is also the place. I think it has 600 whiskeys and bourbons.\n\nOur server, David, was incredible and made the experience that more enjoyable.\n\nIn short, go see this Nashville staple.",

          "text": "I‚Äôve never been more disappointed in a meal in a very long time. We had the Thanksgiving buffet. It was terrible. The strip loin was very overcooked and tough as shoe leather. The mashed potatoes we so soupy that I thought it was a sauce. The stuffing was a gelatinous blob. I don‚Äôt think it could have started off as bread. The sweet potato was more of a dessert (think apple pie sugar and cinnamon filling but substitute sweet potato, topped with marshmallow). The green bean casserole had very little taste. The Mac and cheese was only Mac (dude, where‚Äôs the cheese?!). The rolls and cornbread were so dry and overcooked that they were not edible. For dessert, they ran out of pecan pie. I can see why because the pumpkin pie was the worst I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm not sure what the filling was made from but it was terrible. The only saving grace was the Brussels sprouts. They were prepared well and were very tasty. This restaurant is a hard pass. So disappointed because we are visiting from out of town and were looking for a wonderful Thanksgiving meal. The advertising did not live up to our experience. Please avoid 404 Kitchen if you are looking for a good value for your money. If the chef serves this type of food at a Thanksgiving buffet, I can only imagine the quality when dining with the regular menu.",

Our party shared the butternut squash risotto, lobster mac & cheese, and 72 hour tri tip 28oz steak for main courses. The mac & cheese was my favorite. Dessert brought the 404 bourbon cake, creme br√ªl√©e, and baked apple. Bourbon cake was a clear winner but the mixed fruit compote on the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was a pleasant surprise.\nThe restaurant itself appears small at first pass but it actually sprawls and has lots of private space for large parties. The decor is simple but very classy. The lights did flicker the entire time and that was very distracting and not my favorite. Our server explained that the building was over 100 years old so it has been a problem for a while. The lighting was the only issue I took with this visit. It‚Äôs a Nashville staple and should be on your visit list.",
