He laughed and said \"no if you can hear my accent, I was born and raised here\". We both shared a laugh and he told me the bosses were trained by NYers on how to make pizza. And to me that training was worth whatever they paid for it. My son who's from NY as well says hes been coming here for a few years now. I for sure will add this to our list of places to eat when I come visit. We ordered a half cheese and half special. Which consisted of pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, cheese, basil. And it was amazing. I wish the pizza was a tad bit thicker. But that's my personal opinion. Its great nonetheless. Staff were very friendly and stayed busy for a normal Wednesday evening. Keep up the great work guys.",

He laughed and said \"no if you can hear my accent, I was born and raised here\". We both shared a laugh and he told me the bosses were trained by NYers on how to make pizza. And to me that training was worth whatever they paid for it. My son who's from NY as well says hes been coming here for a few years now. I for sure will add this to our list of places to eat when I come visit. We ordered a half cheese and half special. Which consisted of pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, cheese, basil. And it was amazing. I wish the pizza was a tad bit thicker. But that's my personal opinion. Its great nonetheless. Staff were very friendly and stayed busy for a normal Wednesday evening. Keep up the great work guys.",

Sauce was robust but not overpowering and complimented the toppings well. Highly recommend the white pie for my garlic lovers, bit of a sleeper.\n\nThe staff was kind and friendly. No complaints.\n\nVery surprised to find a pizza place south of the mason Dixon that I would certainly return to.\n\nThanks!",

He laughed and said \"no if you can hear my accent, I was born and raised here\". We both shared a laugh and he told me the bosses were trained by NYers on how to make pizza. And to me that training was worth whatever they paid for it. My son who's from NY as well says hes been coming here for a few years now. I for sure will add this to our list of places to eat when I come visit. We ordered a half cheese and half special. Which consisted of pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, cheese, basil. And it was amazing. I wish the pizza was a tad bit thicker. But that's my personal opinion. Its great nonetheless. Staff were very friendly and stayed busy for a normal Wednesday evening. Keep up the great work guys.",
