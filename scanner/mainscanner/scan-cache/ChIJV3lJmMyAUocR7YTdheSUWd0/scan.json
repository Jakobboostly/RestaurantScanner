The best of the bunch was the cheese garlic bread, which unfortunately got stale quickly because of the travel time (15 minutes). None of the pizzas landed with any member of the family. The margharita pizza in particular was deemed unworthy of a second bite. My take is that ingredients are dumped on the pie without a lot of thought. Ingredients don't get cooked the same, like peppers and onions taste closer to raw than cooked. In general, we had a poor experience.\n\nThere's enough great reviews that I'm willing to dine in and see how the experience compares, but I definitely won't do takeout again (I'll update my review after my visit). As it stands, I wasn't impressed.",

The best of the bunch was the cheese garlic bread, which unfortunately got stale quickly because of the travel time (15 minutes). None of the pizzas landed with any member of the family. The margharita pizza in particular was deemed unworthy of a second bite. My take is that ingredients are dumped on the pie without a lot of thought. Ingredients don't get cooked the same, like peppers and onions taste closer to raw than cooked. In general, we had a poor experience.\n\nThere's enough great reviews that I'm willing to dine in and see how the experience compares, but I definitely won't do takeout again (I'll update my review after my visit). As it stands, I wasn't impressed.",

It was great watching them add the sauce and toppings they chose, then it was baked and brought back for them to eat.\n\nThe pizza was really good and the service we had was great!.

I‚Äôve also had their lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, and chicken parmigiana. Every single dish has been amazing! The portion sizes are huge and I‚Äôve loved every single thing I‚Äôve gotten. My favorite thing about this place is they have so many different options. From pizza, to sandwiches, to freaking ribs! This place is incredible. Oh also, the staff are always super nice. Gabriel is the man!",

Pizza was very similar to back in NY, which I have truly missed. Service was great, and their posted pick-up time was spot on, and I was greeted right away. I will be ordering again my last week here. I travel for work 90% of the year, and this pizza truly matches up with some of the best!",

They are definitely more Italian than your average American pizza with lots of yummy options and new things to try! Customer service was phenomenal. I only took a star away for the atmosphere. It was super laid back like an American pizza joint but this place deserves better in my opinion. I‚Äôd prefer it to be just a bit nicer to match the quality of the food but that‚Äôs just my personal preference.",

From the moment we entered, we were speaking in English‚Äîthis was clear to the staff, including the person who greeted us and the waiter who served us.\n\nHowever, when our waiter approached us, the first thing they asked was, ‚ÄúDo you speak English?‚Äù This question was both unnecessary and disrespectful, especially considering that we had been conversing in English from the start. It made us feel unfairly judged, and we couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if this assumption was based on our appearance.\n\nAs a customer, I expect to be greeted with courtesy and professionalism, starting with a simple ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan I get you something to drink?‚Äù rather than a question that felt dismissive and offensive.\n\nThis experience left a very negative impression, and I wanted to bring it to your attention. I hope steps are taken to ensure your staff treats all guests with respect, regardless of their background.",

The chicken was so soft but not in a good way. You could tell the quality was poor. Normally I would not leave a review like this but we were so disappointed and I‚Äôm hoping they will choose to use better quality meat. We have had the picanha in the best and that was a lot better too. The service was good though!!",
