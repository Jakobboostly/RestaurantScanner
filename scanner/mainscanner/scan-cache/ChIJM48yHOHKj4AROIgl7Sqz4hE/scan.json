It seemed they had a few regulars dining in and each time I'm here I feel like I walked into my neighborhood pizza shop, like where everyone knows your name.\n\nGreat spot - pls support if you visit Santa row or Valley Fair. They have more personality and heart than most places I've worked at or dined in at at those large malls.",

I even used to frequent their Santa Teresa location until it closed. Tony & Alba's and the personal care and family tradition they put into their food has been a memory that has followed me across the globe. If you are curious I recommend you give their pizza shot, it may end up being a good memory for you as well.",

It seemed they had a few regulars dining in and each time I'm here I feel like I walked into my neighborhood pizza shop, like where everyone knows your name.\n\nGreat spot - pls support if you visit Santa row or Valley Fair. They have more personality and heart than most places I've worked at or dined in at at those large malls.",

I am a big fan of their lunch special and always order their pesto pizza and Italian salad. Their salad dressing is simple yet delicious and is a very good-sized portion. They have  had to raise their prices like everyone else, but the quality and taste of their pizza are still worthy of today's  prices. Over the years, I have been treated extremely well by the staff and never had a complaint. Until, my last visit when I was not treated very well at all.\nThere was a large group in front of me who were talking their time, deciding what to order, so I sat down  at a table where I was told by a male staff member that I could not sit at a table till I placed my order.  I have a non visible injury, which makes it hard to stand long periods of time. If this is a new policy that they have implemented, I can respect it if it is posted. I felt singled out and  mistreated and was embarrassed. I will not eat there again for how badly I was treated.\nI can honestly say their food is good, but the customer service that day was sub-par, considering what a long-time customer I have been.",

Here you will find the best Italian mood and food, they will recommend you their best option, the atmosphere is great you have bunch of options to play, read and check while you are waiting, however the waiting is not that long.\nTrust me when I say that the pasta is not heavy at all (lactose intolerant speaking). Desserts are great and for the look of the pizzas...they are amazing.\nGive it a try guys, you wont regret it.",

As a regular customer, they had sent me a text for a FREE one-topping Small pizza. Perfect timing, I went in and ordered a small pepperoni pizza and within 10 or so minutes my piping hot pizza was ready.\nI've always enjoyed Tony & Albas pizza from way back when I was a kid, it's always been my favorite. Perfect crust, homemade sauce with too much sugar and always quality ingredients. Real cheese that stretches as you take a bite and pepperoni that's better than any other pizza by far. You can taste the quality. Definitely satisfied my hunger. Will continue to patronize this family run establishment for years to come.",

It was full of cheese, very greasy, and literally no flavor, I couldnt taste any garlic, no oregano.... nothing! Then I went to go use the bathroom and that was disgusting, this place has clearly not put any effort into remodeling for making these areas clean, it's very outdated but so dirty.\nNeedless to say $30 is not worth the price of their pizza. It's really sad because I don't think that I will be back.",

I am a big fan of their lunch special and always order their pesto pizza and Italian salad. Their salad dressing is simple yet delicious and is a very good-sized portion. They have  had to raise their prices like everyone else, but the quality and taste of their pizza are still worthy of today's  prices. Over the years, I have been treated extremely well by the staff and never had a complaint. Until, my last visit when I was not treated very well at all.\nThere was a large group in front of me who were talking their time, deciding what to order, so I sat down  at a table where I was told by a male staff member that I could not sit at a table till I placed my order.  I have a non visible injury, which makes it hard to stand long periods of time. If this is a new policy that they have implemented, I can respect it if it is posted. I felt singled out and  mistreated and was embarrassed. I will not eat there again for how badly I was treated.\nI can honestly say their food is good, but the customer service that day was sub-par, considering what a long-time customer I have been.",
