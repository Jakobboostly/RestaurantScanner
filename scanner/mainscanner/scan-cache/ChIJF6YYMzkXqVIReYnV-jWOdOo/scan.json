The food is truly good and offers a welcome change from the usual American fare. You can even overlook the fact that the chicken cordon bleu is just formed meat. The terrace is a wonderful place to enjoy the sunset, where there's also a great selection of drinks.",

The batter was perfectly seasoned and crispy, and the tartar sauce was bright and creamy to match. I got the potato wedges as one of the sides, and they were excellent, plus you get a lot of them. We started the meal with their cheese curds, and they were very good. The batter was similar to tempura batter, which makes it light and crispy. We didn't really care for the tomato jam they were served with, so we added a side of their ranch. It is a lighter version of ranch, which cuts the richness of a fried cheese curd very well, and we really enjoyed that. We each had a blueberry spritzer to drink, and I really enjoyed it. It's made with soda water, so it isn't too sweet, but it does have a sugar rim, which adds a controllable amount of sweetness. Overall, it was a good meal and couldn't beat the outdoor seating overlooking Lake Superior.",

The dish consisted of heavily soy sauced tuna and avocados, served with crostini.  Not appetizing at all.  The porterhouse steak for 2 was not much better. The wild rice pilaf was also inedible, as it was completely undercooked and lacking in flavor.  Uncle Ben's would have been better.  The asparagus looked and tasted  like it was microwaved. Overcooked, no seasoning, and came out with a side of butter. The steak was fine, but for $65 a bit pricey if everything else was unfit to eat.  If this expereince had an upside, it was our server, Sofie; she was on top of it and I understand none of the food prep was her fault. She was prompt and courteous. Inpsite of her excellent service, we don't have plans to ever return.",

It could not have tasted more like nothing. Lettuce is more flavorful. They didn‚Äôt even have lime or salt in it at all. Old bland tiny shrimp tomatoes onions and jalape√±os that somehow are not even spicy or flavorful at all. Would never eat here again. So disappointed. The prices and the atmosphere make it seem like it will be great but what a massive disappointment :(.\nI am honestly not hard to please and I never leave bad reviews but I don‚Äôt want to even pay for this because it‚Äôs such a joke :(.",

          "text": "We went for the Friday Fish fry and it was very good. Whitefish can be tricky to get right, and I think they did a good job. The batter was perfectly seasoned and crispy, and the tartar sauce was bright and creamy to match. I got the potato wedges as one of the sides, and they were excellent, plus you get a lot of them. We started the meal with their cheese curds, and they were very good. The batter was similar to tempura batter, which makes it light and crispy. We didn't really care for the tomato jam they were served with, so we added a side of their ranch. It is a lighter version of ranch, which cuts the richness of a fried cheese curd very well, and we really enjoyed that. We each had a blueberry spritzer to drink, and I really enjoyed it. It's made with soda water, so it isn't too sweet, but it does have a sugar rim, which adds a controllable amount of sweetness. Overall, it was a good meal and couldn't beat the outdoor seating overlooking Lake Superior.",

So we tried the Landing and am so glad we did. The waiter was very friendly and was on top of everything. The Easter brunch was just like as if you were at home cooking your Easter Brunch. Food was delicious!! I asked the male waiter, who is the Owner  because I would like to put in a good word for you and he said \" Oh, he is right here\", so we all started to laugh. The Owner was very friendly and had a smile on his face. So I told him what we thought on how the waiter was very friendly and Professional. He smiled and said Thank You. We will definitely be going back. Very Friendly and Welcoming.",

The dish consisted of heavily soy sauced tuna and avocados, served with crostini.  Not appetizing at all.  The porterhouse steak for 2 was not much better. The wild rice pilaf was also inedible, as it was completely undercooked and lacking in flavor.  Uncle Ben's would have been better.  The asparagus looked and tasted  like it was microwaved. Overcooked, no seasoning, and came out with a side of butter. The steak was fine, but for $65 a bit pricey if everything else was unfit to eat.  If this expereince had an upside, it was our server, Sofie; she was on top of it and I understand none of the food prep was her fault. She was prompt and courteous.
