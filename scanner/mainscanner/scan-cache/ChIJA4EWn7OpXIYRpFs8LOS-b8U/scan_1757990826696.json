I mean, pizza generally is like overhyped. The proportions of ingredients and the quality, like the bacon, ham, perfect little diced tomatoes, green onions, pineapple, and whatever kind of cheese they put on here is amazing. And I asked somebody what they thought and she said it‚Äôs like the crust isn‚Äôt crispy, but it‚Äôs not soft. It‚Äôs like perfectly crispy at the bottom but still good and she said it‚Äôs sweet and spicy and perfect and that‚Äôs what I thought somebody else said it was expensive but the truth is you can see the quality of the ingredients when you look at the piece of pizza I hope they do well.",

Mary provided us with excellent friendly and attentive service. She was the only one working the front, taking orders, delivering food to all the customers and busing the table. It was busiest and she did an excellent job doing it all!\nThis is the only pizza restaurant that we‚Äôve found that has linguica as a topping-yummy!!  We ordered the Bacon Cheddar breadstick, they were surprisingly light and delicious but not much bacon bits on them. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and half with linguica, it was delicious. The salad bar was disappointing due to the cost.  Quality ingredients-lettuce, toppings and dressing but didn‚Äôt have any macaroni, potato or pasta salads. I think they‚Äôve only been open for 2 weeks  so hopefully they‚Äôll be installing some window tinting or blinds because in the evening the sun was blinding!!",

          "text": "After a suggestion from a friend that \"Round Table Pizza was awesome\", I decided to give these folks a try. First of all, their \"POS system\" needs to go. It is funny when you first sign up for a rewards account, the POS system mentions how awesome they are. No, they are not \"awesome\". Ironically, I had to order 3 times over 3 days before my order even went through. When I went to the store, I mentioned that about their POS system and the young kid at the counter agreed. After placing the order in the app, I was told it would be ready at a certain time. I get to the location and was told \"5 more minutes\" as its was still in the oven. 5 minutes turned into more than 15 minutes. No, no problem. I get it. Sometimes computers can not get timing right. I had ordered 2 large pizza's and bread twists. I am not sure it is worth them almost $70 I paid for the pizza. I did have a coupon and even with the coupon, it was not worth that cost.\n\nThe pizza was good. I liked the crust. It was chewy and had a good flavor to it. The sauce was tangy and over over powering. The toppings were also not soggy. They did burn the bread twits. Apparently, someone does not know how to use a pizza oven. I was impressed they had a salad bar. You do not see that too often in a pizza place these days.\n\nOverall, the employees were very friendly and professional. The service could use a little help and there is not much you can do about the pizza being a little pricey with food costs the way they are. I do like we have choices when it comes to pizza these days. I am sure their choice of \"POS system\" is a corporate thing. I might suggest they dump it and go to something more robust like Toast. Round Table was a nice change of pace.",

          "text": "As a native Californian, I grew up eating Round Table Pizza. I left Calforning in 2008 and have not had it since. I saw that there were locations in Dallas/Plano and then in San Antonio. I live in South Austin, and last Saturday I woke up and decided I was prepared to make the drive to San Antonio to have Round Table Pizza for the first time in seventeen years. I opened Google Maps and typed in Round Table and clicked the \"See locations\" link. I was ecstatic to see that there are now two locations in San Antonio, one in New Braunfels, and a recently opened location in San Marcos, which is only 25 miles from my house. I raced down Saturday afternoon and had a large King Arthur's Supreme. It took me right back to the days when I would order from Round Table at least once per week. I took the rest home and devoured it on Sunday. On Monday, I was craving Round Table so much that I drove back down to San Marcos again and ordered an Extra Large King Arthur's Supreme and Medium Italian Garlic Supreme (my other favorite). I did not have a salad, but as usual, per the Round Table standards, it looked amazing. I'm excited to try some of the new appetizers as I venture back in the coming weeks. For those of you who love crunchy ice like I do, they have the small crunchy ice that goes so well with a soda.\nThat atmosphere is great. It is clean and inviting. One of the things I like to see most in a restaurant is clean bathrooms. Theirs are immaculate.\nThe staff were great during both visits. Friendly and accommodating.\nFor you Austinites who are craving Round Table Pizza, it's worth the drive to San Marcos. For those of you in North Austin, you lucky folks are getting a location in Round Rock soon. Thank you to Brame Brands for committing to opening more locations.

Mary provided us with excellent friendly and attentive service. She was the only one working the front, taking orders, delivering food to all the customers and busing the table. It was busiest and she did an excellent job doing it all!\nThis is the only pizza restaurant that we‚Äôve found that has linguica as a topping-yummy!!  We ordered the Bacon Cheddar breadstick, they were surprisingly light and delicious but not much bacon bits on them. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and half with linguica, it was delicious. The salad bar was disappointing due to the cost.  Quality ingredients-lettuce, toppings and dressing but didn‚Äôt have any macaroni, potato or pasta salads. I think they‚Äôve only been open for 2 weeks  so hopefully they‚Äôll be installing some window tinting or blinds because in the evening the sun was blinding!!",

          "text": "After a suggestion from a friend that \"Round Table Pizza was awesome\", I decided to give these folks a try. First of all, their \"POS system\" needs to go. It is funny when you first sign up for a rewards account, the POS system mentions how awesome they are. No, they are not \"awesome\". Ironically, I had to order 3 times over 3 days before my order even went through. When I went to the store, I mentioned that about their POS system and the young kid at the counter agreed. After placing the order in the app, I was told it would be ready at a certain time. I get to the location and was told \"5 more minutes\" as its was still in the oven. 5 minutes turned into more than 15 minutes. No, no problem. I get it. Sometimes computers can not get timing right. I had ordered 2 large pizza's and bread twists. I am not sure it is worth them almost $70 I paid for the pizza. I did have a coupon and even with the coupon, it was not worth that cost.\n\nThe pizza was good. I liked the crust. It was chewy and had a good flavor to it. The sauce was tangy and over over powering. The toppings were also not soggy. They did burn the bread twits. Apparently, someone does not know how to use a pizza oven. I was impressed they had a salad bar. You do not see that too often in a pizza place these days.\n\nOverall, the employees were very friendly and professional. The service could use a little help and there is not much you can do about the pizza being a little pricey with food costs the way they are. I do like we have choices when it comes to pizza these days. I am sure their choice of \"POS system\" is a corporate thing. I might suggest they dump it and go to something more robust like Toast. Round Table was a nice change of pace.",

I was wrong. Dead wrong.\n\nRound Table Pizza in San Marcos delivers big time. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm, clean, and genuinely welcoming. The staff? Super friendly, attentive, and on point‚Äîrare for an opening day rush.\n\nAs a diabetic, I was thrilled to see they offer cauliflower crusts for their small pizzas. I ordered two: the Pepperoni Double Play and the King Arthur‚Äôs Supreme, both on cauliflower crust‚Äîand both absolutely phenomenal.\n\nThe Pepperoni Double Play featured both traditional slices and old world pepperoni (you know, the little ones that crisp up into perfect flavor-packed cups). It was bold, crispy, and just greasy enough to satisfy the pizza purist in me.\n\nThen came the King Arthur‚Äôs Supreme‚Äîwow. That thing was loaded. We're talking peppers, onions, mushrooms, sausage, both types of pepperoni, and the real MVP: salami. Salami on a pizza is a revelation. The balance of salty richness with the veggies made every bite feel crafted, not thrown together.\n\nFresh food. Friendly staff. A thoughtful menu. And yes‚Äîsalami on a pizza. Round Table Pizza just knighted itself into my regular rotation.\n\n10/10. Highly recommend.",

And I asked somebody what they thought and she said it‚Äôs like the crust isn‚Äôt crispy, but it‚Äôs not soft. It‚Äôs like perfectly crispy at the bottom but still good and she said it‚Äôs sweet and spicy and perfect and that‚Äôs what I thought somebody else said it was expensive but the truth is you can see the quality of the ingredients when you look at the piece of pizza I hope they do well.",

            "text": "As a native Californian, I grew up eating Round Table Pizza. I left Calforning in 2008 and have not had it since. I saw that there were locations in Dallas/Plano and then in San Antonio. I live in South Austin, and last Saturday I woke up and decided I was prepared to make the drive to San Antonio to have Round Table Pizza for the first time in seventeen years. I opened Google Maps and typed in Round Table and clicked the \"See locations\" link. I was ecstatic to see that there are now two locations in San Antonio, one in New Braunfels, and a recently opened location in San Marcos, which is only 25 miles from my house. I raced down Saturday afternoon and had a large King Arthur's Supreme. It took me right back to the days when I would order from Round Table at least once per week. I took the rest home and devoured it on Sunday. On Monday, I was craving Round Table so much that I drove back down to San Marcos again and ordered an Extra Large King Arthur's Supreme and Medium Italian Garlic Supreme (my other favorite). I did not have a salad, but as usual, per the Round Table standards, it looked amazing. I'm excited to try some of the new appetizers as I venture back in the coming weeks. For those of you who love crunchy ice like I do, they have the small crunchy ice that goes so well with a soda.\nThat atmosphere is great. It is clean and inviting. One of the things I like to see most in a restaurant is clean bathrooms. Theirs are immaculate.\nThe staff were great during both visits. Friendly and accommodating.\nFor you Austinites who are craving Round Table Pizza, it's worth the drive to San Marcos. For those of you in North Austin, you lucky folks are getting a location in Round Rock soon. Thank you to Brame Brands for committing to opening more locations. (Hint, hint, one close to South Austin please :)",

We'll give them another chance in a few months.",
