She was funny, kind, and super attentive without hovering. We appreciated her so much!\nNow onto the food and drinks‚Ä¶\nLet me just say this: I‚Äôve had a lot of mules in my day. Theirs was easily Top 3. The Old Fashioned was also a solid drink. It was smooth and very flavorful.\nAs for the food:\n‚Ä¢\tThe fish and chips were next level. Perfectly golden and flaky inside.\n‚Ä¢\tThe other dish was Chops Diane. It was pure comfort food with elevated flavors. Also, those veggies weren‚Äôt just a side, they were actually seasoned and GOOD.\n‚Ä¢\tEven the empty appetizer basket got a moment of appreciation. Would recommend the cheese curds but they didn‚Äôt stand a chance to photos.\nThis place gets everything right. The flavor, service, and atmosphere were 10/10. Will definitely be back. If you‚Äôre thinking about going‚Ä¶ just do it. And ask for Jackie! üòÅ",

          "text": "Sage & Barrel is a nice place for a casual meal. I attended as President for our team social event. Essentially, it was a business meal for our volunteers to enjoy social time with each other.\n\nThere was 11 of us; it was not enuff people for the separate room. We could have used the separate room, as it was difficult to hear during conversations. It would have been helpful for us to be placed in the separate room.\n\nIt was really noisy in the venue til about 6pm. Then the people there just for drinks left, which quickly made the room quieter.\n\nThe food was good. All of us were pleased with our meal. Some of us had dessert; the desserts were good. Drinks were refilled quickly, which is nice on a hot day. Food and drink prices were as expected, given the nature of these things now.\n\nThe wait staff was quite efficient and pleasant. The waitress was quite patient with us; she explained what was in some meals [spices, some ingredients] for a few group members.\n\nThe table was cleared of plates and flatware in the expected length of time. The owner stopped by to say \"thank you for coming here,\" which was a nice and unexpected touch.\n\nWe will go back to Sage & Barrel again for future social events.  Sept 2025",

          "text": "Sage & Barrel is a nice place for a casual meal. I attended as President for our team social event. Essentially, it was a business meal for our volunteers to enjoy social time with each other.\n\nThere was 11 of us; it was not enuff people for the separate room. We could have used the separate room, as it was difficult to hear during conversations. It would have been helpful for us to be placed in the separate room.\n\nIt was really noisy in the venue til about 6pm. Then the people there just for drinks left, which quickly made the room quieter.\n\nThe food was good. All of us were pleased with our meal. Some of us had dessert; the desserts were good. Drinks were refilled quickly, which is nice on a hot day. Food and drink prices were as expected, given the nature of these things now.\n\nThe wait staff was quite efficient and pleasant. The waitress was quite patient with us; she explained what was in some meals [spices, some ingredients] for a few group members.\n\nThe table was cleared of plates and flatware in the expected length of time. The owner stopped by to say \"thank you for coming here,\" which was a nice and unexpected touch.\n\nWe will go back to Sage & Barrel again for future social events.  Sept 2025",

          "text": "First time here 9.5.25 745ish... Had no expectations but a good meal. Looked at menu and was impressed large selection and variety of options.  The decor and energy felt very good upon entering. Although quite loud, and 80% filled was a very good vibe. Met immediately,  sat quickly. Took several minutes to be greeted by server, slow but expected to a degree.\n\nOrdered appetizer Brussel sprouts perfect delicious. I ordered crispy chicken breast with mashed and gravy with green beans. Beans delicious but way overcooked, mashed whipped smooth but near little flavor and same with gravy in my opinion which is expected in some places, unexpected here especially when advertised as herbed seasoned. The crispy chicken was absolutely juicy and easily cut with just a fork, tenderly prepared golden brown. The breading plain and bland otherwise diminishing a wonderful chicken breast. Overall, my meal was nothing I would choose to order again. The other meal was fish and chips which frankly was darn good comparatively despite its own hurdles.  A huge whole fillet, not greasy, hot and tender. Way too much breading but likely necessary to hold such a long fillet together. But not certain. The tartar sauce was surprisingly tasty and had a hint of bite perhaps horseradish...but delicious and cold. The fries completely fresh cut and fried golden brown but very soggy and I know the reason as to why.\n\nThose who read my reviews know im brutally honest be it a 1 or a 10...sequencing food takes a level of precision and kitchen management knows this fact.  Our brussel sprouts came out late (probably 12.15 minutes from order) the runner delivered and said your food is up as she is delivering appetizer and asked if we wanted it now. Of course we said no as we wanted the sprouts or else why order as an appetizer right?. That spelled doom to me who grew up in my father's restaurant business. Although delicious,  appetizers can and did harm the meal from timing and sequencing. Fries when delivered were no longer crispy but soggy soft, gravy on mashed potatoes had filmed over instead of being wet and steamy. They had to bring out our meal before we got done with sprouts because of an error along the communication channels and somebody was finally paying attention to how much time they were sitting. Now, we have a filled table of dishes, food not delivered as intended by the chef, and a not so shiny review because the meal is the ultimate prize or is intended to be such. This is not on our server at all and 3 star service is because of the mistakes I outlined above and below.\n\nI know it's hard to find or develop chemistry on and in any team with so many moving parts. I do think somebody needs to work on that from kitchen to table. If I were to have another experience like this a 2nd time, I would absolutely not go back a 3rd time. Mistakes happen. Same mistakes, that's a trend management is responsible for.\n\nOne final item unfortunately to share. An advertisement for a tiny signature drink for $12 should be if nothing else good or bad needs to be crafted consistent. I was driving,  so I did not order the \"lemon drop\" advertised drink but I did have a sip of each. First one was more yellow than the 2nd one which was more pink. 1st one had a fresh lemon slice and was very very tart.  The 2nd had a dried lime slice and was much sweeter both had a sugary rim. How can they be so different if the recipe is used or did bartender(s) just do whatever they chose? I don't know but the inconsistencies across food and drinks makes me question what's going on there.\n\nMaybe it was a bad night for some? Maybe understaffed or new staff? Maybe something else? I know the kitchen definitely faltered.\n\nI will go back as I firmly believe stuff happens and there may not be an explanation determination and a 2nd chance is nearly always deserved especially with a restaurant.  Time will make the determination.",

My wife had the pork loin with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I had the salmon with truffle fries and vegetables.  We shared a wedge salad and shrimp appetizer.  The service was excellent, and the server was very attentive, refilling our beverages without needing to ask, and offering good recommendations for our dishes.  Atmosphere is clean and spacious.  This was our first time here, and we will definitely be returning in the future.  One of the best restaurants we have found in the East Valley.",

My husband is from Wisconsin and was thrilled with the many menu items that bought up memories from home.  The cheese curds were the best we‚Äôve had in the valley.  We both had the fried fish, he had beer battered and I had the cornmeal.  My husband is a French Fry snob and actually thought the were good fries. My fish was tough, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs why the food is only a 4.  I had the Beer Cheese soup with my fish and absolutely loved it.",

Their summer menu's Elderflower Gin Spritz hit the spot on a hot August afternoon, and the wedge salad was not wimpy. It is a full plate of fresh, crispy veg with delicious and indulgent blue cheese and crispy, thick bacon. Definitely add grilled shrimp! Cynthia was a gem on service, attentive and fast, making me feel welcomed without being overbearing. A great place for casual meet-ups with incredible fare.",

Essentially, it was a business meal for our volunteers to enjoy social time with each other.\n\nThere was 11 of us; it was not enuff people for the separate room. We could have used the separate room, as it was difficult to hear during conversations. It would have been helpful for us to be placed in the separate room.\n\nIt was really noisy in the venue til about 6pm. Then the people there just for drinks left, which quickly made the room quieter.\n\nThe food was good. All of us were pleased with our meal. Some of us had dessert; the desserts were good. Drinks were refilled quickly, which is nice on a hot day. Food and drink prices were as expected, given the nature of these things now.\n\nThe wait staff was quite efficient and pleasant. The waitress was quite patient with us; she explained what was in some meals [spices, some ingredients] for a few group members.\n\nThe table was cleared of plates and flatware in the expected length of time. The owner stopped by to say \"thank you for coming here,\" which was a nice and unexpected touch.\n\nWe will go back to Sage & Barrel again for future social events.  Sept 2025",

The decor and energy felt very good upon entering. Although quite loud, and 80% filled was a very good vibe. Met immediately,  sat quickly. Took several minutes to be greeted by server, slow but expected to a degree.\n\nOrdered appetizer Brussel sprouts perfect delicious. I ordered crispy chicken breast with mashed and gravy with green beans. Beans delicious but way overcooked, mashed whipped smooth but near little flavor and same with gravy in my opinion which is expected in some places, unexpected here especially when advertised as herbed seasoned. The crispy chicken was absolutely juicy and easily cut with just a fork, tenderly prepared golden brown. The breading plain and bland otherwise diminishing a wonderful chicken breast. Overall, my meal was nothing I would choose to order again. The other meal was fish and chips which frankly was darn good comparatively despite its own hurdles.  A huge whole fillet, not greasy, hot and tender. Way too much breading but likely necessary to hold such a long fillet together. But not certain. The tartar sauce was surprisingly tasty and had a hint of bite perhaps horseradish...but delicious and cold. The fries completely fresh cut and fried golden brown but very soggy and I know the reason as to why.\n\nThose who read my reviews know im brutally honest be it a 1 or a 10...sequencing food takes a level of precision and kitchen management knows this fact.  Our brussel sprouts came out late (probably 12.15 minutes from order) the runner delivered and said your food is up as she is delivering appetizer and asked if we wanted it now. Of course we said no as we wanted the sprouts or else why order as an appetizer right?. That spelled doom to me who grew up in my father's restaurant business. Although delicious,  appetizers can and did harm the meal from timing and sequencing. Fries when delivered were no longer crispy but soggy soft, gravy on mashed potatoes had filmed over instead of being wet and steamy. They had to bring out our meal before we got done with sprouts because of an error along the communication channels and somebody was finally paying attention to how much time they were sitting. Now, we have a filled table of dishes, food not delivered as intended by the chef, and a not so shiny review because the meal is the ultimate prize or is intended to be such. This is not on our server at all and 3 star service is because of the mistakes I outlined above and below.\n\nI know it's hard to find or develop chemistry on and in any team with so many moving parts. I do think somebody needs to work on that from kitchen to table. If I were to have another experience like this a 2nd time, I would absolutely not go back a 3rd time. Mistakes happen. Same mistakes, that's a trend management is responsible for.\n\nOne final item unfortunately to share. An advertisement for a tiny signature drink for $12 should be if nothing else good or bad needs to be crafted consistent. I was driving,  so I did not order the \"lemon drop\" advertised drink but I did have a sip of each. First one was more yellow than the 2nd one which was more pink. 1st one had a fresh lemon slice and was very very tart.  The 2nd had a dried lime slice and was much sweeter both had a sugary rim. How can they be so different if the recipe is used or did bartender(s) just do whatever they chose? I don't know but the inconsistencies across food and drinks makes me question what's going on there.\n\nMaybe it was a bad night for some? Maybe understaffed or new staff? Maybe something else? I know the kitchen definitely faltered.\n\nI will go back as I firmly believe stuff happens and there may not be an explanation determination and a 2nd chance is nearly always deserved especially with a restaurant.  Time will make the determination.",
