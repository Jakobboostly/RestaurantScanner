I ordered a cocktail the Dory and it was amazing. The atmosphere was okay, the music was great. The only thing that we hated was the fact that after we sit down, the host sit a couple behind us that got serviced first with drinks and appetizers. I had to go to the front desk to ask them to send us a waiter  because it had passed 20 minutes and no one had come to the table to at least take our drink order. Very unprofessional.

Upon arriving, we realized that they were not able to accommodate this many people at all. They told us last minute that we would have to sit in front of the music because that was the only place they were able to accommodate us and if that was fine obviously we had no other choice. Where else are we gonna find a restaurant that  takes 19 people? The music was super loud and they were not coordinated at all. The food runner, young female was extremely rude. She made multiple ugly faces at us. The server was better, but not by much. They all had an attitude and were mad at us because we couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying. I suggest if you are going to sit a huge table right next to the music to at least accommodate them by telling the musicians to pause  the music for a bit while orders are taken. I did not appreciate having to scream into the server‚Äôs ear while taking my order It was both frustrating for her and I. I understand why they were frustrated, because we were too, but making faces and sighing directly into our face is extremely unprofessional. Bill was around $1000. Food was great but they kept bringing out random food and didn‚Äôt know where it went. but everybody did end up eating at different times because nothing came out at the same time. I understand with big tables not all food is going to come at the same time, but there was definitely some ways they could‚Äôve held it off. Expo could‚Äôve told line cooks to hold off sushi while hamburgers were being made, but they did not clearly because sushi came out a couple minutes after our order was placed. I also suggest in putting seats numbers or at least a note section so you know if the food is for a booth or not because aside from the food runner coming out with a horrible attitude, she didn‚Äôt even know where she was going. The server also did not repeat any of our orders to make sure anything was correct so there was a lot of complications, especially with the 19 top i think it‚Äôs crucial to repeat the order especially  when you can‚Äôt even hear what they‚Äôre ordering. Overall, aside from the food, everything else was not great and for $1000 we were disappointed. We were not even able to talk about each other because the music was so loud. Owner really needs to make sure their workers do not bring that horrible attitude into the work environment because it very much can ruin somebody‚Äôs experience and they should also look into how loud the music is because that definitely takes a huge part in their attitude\n\nEDIT:\nI also find it crazy they charged us $136 for a large party which is something people charge when they‚Äôre able to take a large party, but they weren‚Äôt even able to take us all. I am also noticing they charged us five horchatas when we returned three of them because we did not enjoy them and exchange them for a soda mind you the drinks were completely filled because we did not like them at all.",

I ordered a cocktail the Dory and it was amazing. The atmosphere was okay, the music was great. The only thing that we hated was the fact that after we sit down, the host sit a couple behind us that got serviced first with drinks and appetizers. I had to go to the front desk to ask them to send us a waiter  because it had passed 20 minutes and no one had come to the table to at least take our drink order. Very unprofessional. The food was delivered with in 15 minutes.",

I ordered 1 aguachile n a drink , they brought me some chips at the beginning (not that I ordered myself) after I finished my meal and alcohol drink I ordered I ask for water to help bring the food down, after that I asked for the bill. The bill came and it was $82 yes they charged me $4.98 for chips and $9 for water.  $38 for aguachiles and $22 for the drink .. I have never been charged for chips and water lol .. oh and then they had $8 for parking .. no wonder they want to cater to non educated individuals that fall for this culture of being taken advantage of!! I will never go back worst restaurant out there take my word!!",

The rolls cost more here than a traditional sushi spot. The food took longer to get to my table. It was 2 rolls for a party of 2. Another party of like 8 came after us and got their food served first. Also, there is a camera dude that takes pictures and then tries to sell it to you. If you want to chill chill then I do not recommend this place. It is worth checking it out though. You may have a better experience or it might be your fit.",

The only thing that we hated was the fact that after we sit down, the host sit a couple behind us that got serviced first with drinks and appetizers. I had to go to the front desk to ask them to send us a waiter  because it had passed 20 minutes and no one had come to the table to at least take our drink order. Very unprofessional.

            "text": "came here for a 19 top birthday dinner. When making the reservation I specifically asked if they were ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE that many people which they proceeded to say yes. Upon arriving, we realized that they were not able to accommodate this many people at all. They told us last minute that we would have to sit in front of the music because that was the only place they were able to accommodate us and if that was fine obviously we had no other choice. Where else are we gonna find a restaurant that  takes 19 people? The music was super loud and they were not coordinated at all. The food runner, young female was extremely rude. She made multiple ugly faces at us. The server was better, but not by much. They all had an attitude and were mad at us because we couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying. I suggest if you are going to sit a huge table right next to the music to at least accommodate them by telling the musicians to pause  the music for a bit while orders are taken. I did not appreciate having to scream into the server‚Äôs ear while taking my order It was both frustrating for her and I. I understand why they were frustrated, because we were too, but making faces and sighing directly into our face is extremely unprofessional. Bill was around $1000. Food was great but they kept bringing out random food and didn‚Äôt know where it went. but everybody did end up eating at different times because nothing came out at the same time. I understand with big tables not all food is going to come at the same time, but there was definitely some ways they could‚Äôve held it off. Expo could‚Äôve told line cooks to hold off sushi while hamburgers were being made, but they did not clearly because sushi came out a couple minutes after our order was placed. I also suggest in putting seats numbers or at least a note section so you know if the food is for a booth or not because aside from the food runner coming out with a horrible attitude, she didn‚Äôt even know where she was going. The server also did not repeat any of our orders to make sure anything was correct so there was a lot of complications, especially with the 19 top i think it‚Äôs crucial to repeat the order especially  when you can‚Äôt even hear what they‚Äôre ordering. Overall, aside from the food, everything else was not great and for $1000 we were disappointed. We were not even able to talk about each other because the music was so loud. Owner really needs to make sure their workers do not bring that horrible attitude into the work environment because it very much can ruin somebody‚Äôs experience and they should also look into how loud the music is because that definitely takes a huge part in their attitude\n\nEDIT:\nI also find it crazy they charged us $136 for a large party which is something people charge when they‚Äôre able to take a large party, but they weren‚Äôt even able to take us all. I am also noticing they charged us five horchatas when we returned three of them because we did not enjoy them and exchange them for a soda mind you the drinks were completely filled because we did not like them at all.",

            "text": "Went there today , now I understand why the term no other worse enemy of a Mexican than another Mexican..This restaurant has completely lost its mind thinking they can charge for everything. I ordered 1 aguachile n a drink , they brought me some chips at the beginning (not that I ordered myself) after I finished my meal and alcohol drink I ordered I ask for water to help bring the food down, after that I asked for the bill. The bill came and it was $82 yes they charged me $4.98 for chips and $9 for water.  $38 for aguachiles and $22 for the drink .. I have never been charged for chips and water lol .. oh and then they had $8 for parking .. no wonder they want to cater to non educated individuals that fall for this culture of being taken advantage of!! I will never go back worst restaurant out there take my word!!",
