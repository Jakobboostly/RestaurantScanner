I ordered a classic Margherita and a pepperoni (also cheap tasting pepperoni, like it's from a sandwich bag from Walmart)‚Äîtwo simple pizzas‚Äîbut the experience was far from satisfying. The cheese they used was not only unappetizing but also unevenly distributed, with a huge glob dumped right in the center of the pizza which ruined the entire pizza - it also lacked sauce. The only redeeming quality was the cheesy garlic bread. First and Last visit.",

The garlic bread was not my favorite but my son liked it very much.\nThe service was good and the man making the pizza was quick and very nice to us.  This is certainly a place we will return to for a pie.  They also have a few other items on the men√∫, like hummus and the  mediterrean pizza üçï  that looked quite interesting.",

There were 8 of us who shared a whole pizza and there was half left over so that speaks for itself. The area is a bit rough there were many smoking blunts in there cars and in the parking lot near there cars it was very strong. The staff was very nice and friendly so this should be known- its just the pizza, cheese bread and calzone that was not to our liking. We all sat down and did a taste comparison to me n eds and we all agreed picking the same pizza place that tastes best- pizza hut wins for chicken wings. I would recommend getting the dough less rough-  now take into consideration there were 6 adults and 2 children reviewing this pizza. Best of luck",

There were 8 of us who shared a whole pizza and there was half left over so that speaks for itself. The area is a bit rough there were many smoking blunts in there cars and in the parking lot near there cars it was very strong. The staff was very nice and friendly so this should be known- its just the pizza, cheese bread and calzone that was not to our liking. We all sat down and did a taste comparison to me n eds and we all agreed picking the same pizza place that tastes best- pizza hut wins for chicken wings. I would recommend getting the dough less rough-  now take into consideration there were 6 adults and 2 children reviewing this pizza. Best of luck",

The cheese they used was not only unappetizing but also unevenly distributed, with a huge glob dumped right in the center of the pizza which ruined the entire pizza - it also lacked sauce. The only redeeming quality was the cheesy garlic bread. First and Last visit.",
