The yams and baked beans tasted very good.  I didn't see green beans available, so I went for two sweat sides.  The five sauces were interesting but I settled on Memphis.  The unbranded sodas were a nice option.  I went for Birch Beer.  Plenty of tables were available at 6 pm on a Monday.  Plenty of parking was available when I visited.  I later found that salt was available in my utensil package,  but salt wasn't needed after all.  I didn't see the check-in kiosks so I submitted my order verbally.  Overall the meal was very tasty but the price was higher than I expected.",

The yams and baked beans tasted very good.  I didn't see green beans available, so I went for two sweat sides.  The five sauces were interesting but I settled on Memphis.  The unbranded sodas were a nice option.  I went for Birch Beer.  Plenty of tables were available at 6 pm on a Monday.  Plenty of parking was available when I visited.  I later found that salt was available in my utensil package,  but salt wasn't needed after all.  I didn't see the check-in kiosks so I submitted my order verbally.  Overall the meal was very tasty but the price was higher than I expected.",

We tried the jalape√±o cornbread, St. Louis ribs, brisket, and jalape√±o cheddar sausage, and everything was packed with flavor and cooked to perfection. Great smoke, great seasoning, and just the right amount of heat. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",

The garlic toast was salty, and the fries were a little too sweet. But baby...the baked beans are the bees knees. I will be back for more!",

            "text": "Food items were very tasty.  The brisket was plentiful but I prefer a moister brisket.  This brisket wasn't dry but very mildly moist.  I like more fat.  It was still tasty.  The yams and baked beans tasted very good.  I didn't see green beans available, so I went for two sweat sides.  The five sauces were interesting but I settled on Memphis.  The unbranded sodas were a nice option.  I went for Birch Beer.  Plenty of tables were available at 6 pm on a Monday.  Plenty of parking was available when I visited.  I later found that salt was available in my utensil package,  but salt wasn't needed after all.  I didn't see the check-in kiosks so I submitted my order verbally.  Overall the meal was very tasty but the price was higher than I expected.",
