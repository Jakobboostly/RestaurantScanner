When we opened the boxes at home, we found that our cheese pizza had hardly any cheese. The taco pizza had only hamburger on it. That's it. No cheese, no chips, lettuce... The fries tasted like they were fried in old oil. Not a great experience. And the worst part was that we had ordered because we had company in town. When I went back to Bruno's to discuss this issue, I told them I would rather hash it out in person, than write a bad review. The manager was thankful, and said she would have corporate send me a gift certificate for the amount of my order, but it would take up to 6 weeks. That time came and went; I called, and they assured me it was still on the way. Well, here it is, 7 months later, and still nothing. I'm not giving this up, but I can for sure say we won't be eating there anymore. And I'd warn you away from take out too.",

Our last visit was pretty bad and management doesn't seem to care after we wrote in to them requesting response (there hasn't been one).\n\nWe ordered take out and ended up getting someone else's food, which we didn't realize till we got back home. Not a problem at all, so right away we call it in to be told that they had noticed something was wrong! Kinda weird they said that, but not a problem, these things happen so I ask to have our order fixed and was told they would send it out quick and should arrive in 25.\n\nA couple more calls back and an hour and a half later, the correct pizza finally arrives lukewarm. Apparently the driver had other orders to deliver, and I'm betting we were the last priority. We were told twice that the order was on its way and we felt lied to. We didn't even get to keep the other pizza at the end of all this. We still tipped the driver too, cuz it probably wasn't his fault, but wishing we hadn't after the pizza was barely warm.\n\nDo yourself a favor and just go somewhere else.",

They didn‚Äôt check on us once after they dropped off the pizza to see how it was going but to just drop off the check.
