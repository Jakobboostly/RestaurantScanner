Oh, let me tell you, it‚Äôs like dining in a grand, expansive hall where comfort and style meet in perfect harmony. There's room to breathe, savor, and immerse yourself in the experience without feeling crowded or rushed. Speaking of speed, I've never seen such efficiency paired with such quality. Our food arrived in a flash, yet every bite felt like it had been crafted with meticulous care.\nDon't forget about the 15% student discount!!\nAnd the chicken? Forget what you know about good chicken because this was next-level. Juicy, flavorful, and cooked to absolute perfection. Each bite was a symphony of taste that left me in awe. Honestly, this place isn't just a restaurant, it's a destination, an event, a celebration of all that is good in the culinary world. I can‚Äôt wait to return!",

We stopped by this cute little Chinese restaurant.  There were 3 women working around who were very friendly.  The young man at the register was very unhelpful and very unfriendly.  But that was the only bad thing about this restaurant.  The portions were huge and the food was amazing.  We ordered Teriyaki chicken and steak with rice.  The portion was huge and the food was so yummy!  We also ordered the coconut chicken and noodles!  Amazing!!  We love Chinese food and will definitely be back!!",

Oh, let me tell you, it‚Äôs like dining in a grand, expansive hall where comfort and style meet in perfect harmony. There's room to breathe, savor, and immerse yourself in the experience without feeling crowded or rushed. Speaking of speed, I've never seen such efficiency paired with such quality. Our food arrived in a flash, yet every bite felt like it had been crafted with meticulous care.\nDon't forget about the 15% student discount!!\nAnd the chicken? Forget what you know about good chicken because this was next-level. Juicy, flavorful, and cooked to absolute perfection. Each bite was a symphony of taste that left me in awe. Honestly, this place isn't just a restaurant, it's a destination, an event, a celebration of all that is good in the culinary world. I can‚Äôt wait to return!",

My husband ordered the steak and shrimp Terriyaki with lo mein and it did not disappoint. Meat was tender and full of flavor the noodles were not greasy and tasted amazing. I got Sesame chicken and fried rice. The fried rice was simple but tasty and the Sesame chicken was delicious. They game with veggies and the broccoli was so fresh and perfectly cooked. Their cream cheese wonton are the best I've had in utah county. Be sure to try their mochi donuts as well. The staff is so nice and friendly and the place is so clean and pleasant.",
