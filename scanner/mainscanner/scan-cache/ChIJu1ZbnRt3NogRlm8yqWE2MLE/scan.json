The food was ready on time and we were able to pick up the food and it is definitely simple and convenient process.  The store is located closer to main way and has limited parking. there was plenty of tables.The interior is good for dine in.The staff is friendly and welcoming.   The food is okay. We ordered a Calzone and Veggie subs. The Calzone was okay but the subs were good. Overall its worth a try.",

          "text": "I pass this place everyday on my way home from work and always thought of giving it a try. My coworker came in today with pizza from DeFelice and I was immediately sold upon seeing it.\n\nOn my way home from work today, I called DeFelice numerous times for a pick up order with no one picking up. It was 5:00 p.m. so I knew they were busy. I called again around 6:30, I was hung up on trying one last time before giving up. An employee finally answered this time.\n\nI ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and was told it'd be ready in 45 minutes.\nI went and picked up my pizza eating it in the dining room.\n\nThe pizza looks way better than it actually tastes. It's the blandest, most flavorless pizza I've ever had in my whole entire life. It was the very first time I've ever put salt on that pizza to add flavor which says a whole lot. üò¨\n\nThe slices are huge, fulfilling and nourishing. I was starving so at least it made me full\n\nWhile dining, I overheard one of the obvious longtime employees complaining about the 5pm dinner rush and how she just lets the phone just ring instead of answering. I was so turned off after hearing this because I figured that's what was going on earlier when my calls went unanswered. üò§\n\nThere was another young employee there who I think was her first day on the job. She was a complete sweetheart and did an amazing job serving the customers. You rock!\n\nThis was an unsatisfying experience and I won't be back. You are much better off going to Pizza Hut down the road.",

We ordered for Valentines day, I understand it was busy, but the customer service was horrible. We were told we would have a credit for our food. Called back to use it and the owner was rude and disrespectful,  pretty much said we were lying to her. They have lost our business. We have watched, through the drive thru window, their employees eat out of containers and blatantly ignore customers. Biggest downfall is the horrible customer service and the owner is right up there with them,  so I guess you learn what you are taught.\n\nUpdate:\nManager did have her employee call back and try to make it right after they went back and found it. While the employee did call back the manager/owner as she called herself did not even have the courtesy to call back and talk to us herself. So we will remain ex-customers! That is horrible service!",

The pizza and bread sticks were undercooked. Ordered 3 heart pizzas but was given 1 heart and the rest regular. Was very overcrowded inside with a very long line. The parking lot is extremely cramped. Almost got rear ended try to pull out.The workers there are not professional at all. If you ask them a question they will tell you that they don't know, then won't follow up. And don't bother trying to call them. It rang for 12 minutes before I hung up. All in all this establishment isn't very good.",

Therefore if you are asking questions about the menu..... They have to look at menu or ask someone who then has to ask someone else and so on. Delivery orders take a long time. Way longer then how long they say it will be. They rarely bring napkins or silverware and 3 out of 5 times the good was not hot. The food is excellent though! It's nice that they hire young kids but they need to have an experienced adult on all shifts as well!",

So I have no reference\n\nService as mentioned a lot of high school people it seems at the counter knowledge on the low side but they are always friendly good folks.\n\nFood comment below my Texas run-on below,\n\nMe- work up here occasionally from Texas.  In Texas some local places but the market is dominated really by the big 3-4 matinal chains then of course several other national but small foot print chains.  Mom and pops style places kinda rare besides major cities, or local small town places usually offering wings and bread with spaghetti sauce on it. Up here though many local small regional chains.  With a wide variety of pizza styles and offerings.\nIn st Clairsville I have had 3-4 different places.  These guys are my go to.  Diverse menu without of good items.  Never had a bad \" new food\" experience here.  Not gonna say it's some gourmet experience but the food is ways working man good solid stuff. This is a small local chain.  I have expeeienced in other towns around the are they have all been solid choices as well.\n\nJust keep in mind, back home we have lots of BBQ chicken and Taco places, up here sandwiches and Italian food tend to regin Supreme.\n\nThe food\nI get now default to, the \" Supreme\" everything pizza, as others mentioned it is sorta ( Crust pizza hut like), price $20 ish for the large  but it is good... the toppings the toppings these guys do not skimp the pizza is loaded with meat or veggies --both- flavors very good stuff. In fact  I usualy scarpe the toppings of two slices, save it and mix Into a can of tomato soup, and air fry the crust for a great meal later in the week, I gradients taste crunch feel fresh and not cheep.  Sauce not bad,\n\nSandwiches I have had about 4 different ones all top notch. Good meat great prices.\nWings are wings to me but these are good.\nThe appetizers the sausage and peppers In sauce nearly a meal on  its own.  That and a sandwich you have supper for two days easy.\n\nIove the food here, and it's value I promise you will not eat this well and feel your dollars are respected anywhere else In town. Between the food and price your stealing and \" getting away with it\" .",

Of course I googled and looked at many places to eat and just happened to see DeFelice.\n\nWe parked, went inside and found they had a pizza buffet and salad bar. We asked how long was the Buffet open. We were told it was open for about 30 minutes more. We hurried up and all of us enjoyed the salad bar and buffet.\n\nThe waitress was nice and said she was going to get a few more pizzas made for us to enjoy. Very nice of them.\n\nThe pizza buffet and salad bar were both really good, the waitress was very nice and attentive to what we needed like drinks and such.\n\nThe pizza crust to me seemed similar to a pizza hut crust which I like and the pizza sauce was a nice rich pizza sauce which I also like.\n\nThank you,\nThe Murray's",

The food was ready on time and we were able to pick up the food and it is definitely simple and convenient process.  The store is located closer to main way and has limited parking. there was plenty of tables.The interior is good for dine in.The staff is friendly and welcoming.   The food is okay. We ordered a Calzone and Veggie subs. The Calzone was okay but the subs were good. Overall its worth a try.",
