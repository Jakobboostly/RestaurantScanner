Also, sadly, it took 20 mins to get a bagel, which I don't think should take that long. On the positive side, nice ambiance with great outdoor seating.",

In the past they had always messed up my orders but they had just reopened. But today I just tried to grab a black and white cookie and a fruit danish. Instead of just completing the transaction and grabbing the two pastries that were right next to him I was given a buzzer to wait, irritating but not that big of a deal. When my order was ready I told them they got my order wrong. Without even really acknowledging me they just snatched the incorrect food from my hand. And when I reached out my hand thinking they were going to hand me my new order They just kind of threw it at me and it hit the counter. Really unnecessarily hostile environment now.",
