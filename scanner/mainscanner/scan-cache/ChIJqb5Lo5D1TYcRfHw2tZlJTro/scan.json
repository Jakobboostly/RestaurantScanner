I wish there was a way to give them 10 stars. I will be coming here again and again. They have a great atmosphere with Karaoke and open mic for all ages and skills.",

The food was good and we were happy. The service was very nice. Our server Luna was kind and attentive. We thought it a fun quirk that my husband received his sprite in a bottle. The atmosphere was fun. Old car and service station signs and decor. This was in an old town shopping center all buildings were wood and looked it was the old west.",

We started off with the Vintage Onion Flower which was good but had some uncooked batter and onion towards the middle but would order again. The sauce for the onion flower was great. My wife had the Chopped Cobb Salad with chicken that was OK. The chicken was very good but the salad with blue cheese was just average as they left brown spots on the avocado. Would only recommend it if you like blue cheese. I ordered the cowboy burger with fries. The fries are wonderful and so is the fry sauce. The burger had a great bun and good toppings but the patty was not fresh and is just one of the frozen ones you can get at Costco so order the right wellness. We had some high hopes and left a little disappointed. Service was average and they never refilled the water. Overall a 3 star place that has a good onion flower and fries.",

The location alone is a great enough reason to drop by and see the cool old buildings\nIf you're coming for drinks the bar was very diverse selection wise and bartenders were great. At least a 9/10 and definitely worth a visit.",

The food was good and we were happy. The service was very nice. Our server Luna was kind and attentive. We thought it a fun quirk that my husband received his sprite in a bottle. The atmosphere was fun. Old car and service station signs and decor. This was in an old town shopping center all buildings were wood and looked it was the old west.",

          "text": "Vintage Restaurant Bar & Grill is a little place that has a mix of good and okay items. My wife and I are here for a late lunch after riding the Heber Creeper. We started off with the Vintage Onion Flower which was good but had some uncooked batter and onion towards the middle but would order again. The sauce for the onion flower was great. My wife had the Chopped Cobb Salad with chicken that was OK. The chicken was very good but the salad with blue cheese was just average as they left brown spots on the avocado. Would only recommend it if you like blue cheese. I ordered the cowboy burger with fries. The fries are wonderful and so is the fry sauce. The burger had a great bun and good toppings but the patty was not fresh and is just one of the frozen ones you can get at Costco so order the right wellness. We had some high hopes and left a little disappointed. Service was average and they never refilled the water. Overall a 3 star place that has a good onion flower and fries.",

At least a 9/10 and definitely worth a visit.",

We started off with the Vintage Onion Flower which was good but had some uncooked batter and onion towards the middle but would order again. The sauce for the onion flower was great. My wife had the Chopped Cobb Salad with chicken that was OK. The chicken was very good but the salad with blue cheese was just average as they left brown spots on the avocado. Would only recommend it if you like blue cheese. I ordered the cowboy burger with fries. The fries are wonderful and so is the fry sauce. The burger had a great bun and good toppings but the patty was not fresh and is just one of the frozen ones you can get at Costco so order the right wellness. We had some high hopes and left a little disappointed. Service was average and they never refilled the water. Overall a 3 star place that has a good onion flower and fries.",

I ordered the chicken vintage bowl and it was delicious, chicken was soft and juice, rice was puffy and perfectly seasoned, the veggies were cooked to perfection, also ordered their Bacon burger and Buffalo wings, it all was delicious. I wish there was a way to give them 10 stars. I will be coming here again and again. They have a great atmosphere with Karaoke and open mic for all ages and skills.",
