Ordered a large cheese pizza for pickup, walked in to this janky shop that seemed to be half put together, only to find this clearly very miserable woman, and a man who was so stoned he seemed to be either on Mars or Pluto, I couldn't tell. But anyways, she comes over to the counter and asks my finace can I help you? Before I continue, every single time I have ordered a pizza in the 30 years of my existence, picking it up goes the same way. Walk in, say \"i placed an order for pickup\" and the waitress responds with either \"what did you have?\", \"phone number?\" Or \"name?\". Well the miserable, regretful waitress decides to do the hand rolling gesture to my fianc√© while making a face as if to make her seem stupid. A joke of an employee, and a joke of a pizza shop. The cheese is also clearly bagged and comes from a sysco truck. Years of working in a pizza shop where they use fresh ingredients and care about their customers is how I know. Save the 21 dollars for a cheese pizza and give it to a homeless man if you're considering ordering here. Now I see why they are bribing people with free food for a 5 star review. Most businesses earn their reviews. ü´°",

I looked inside and there were two or three very small thinly sliced pieces of Turkey. Barely anything! Very disappointed. Skimping on the meat is not good. You just lost my business. Charged me $25 for sandwiches that likely only cost them $6 to make. You need to make people a REAL sandwich! That means at least 6 slices of Turkey. I think subway gives people 12 slices of Turkey for a foot long sub! Take a lesson from them. You should be embasrassed. Oh well, I overspent with you, but I'm getting my money back. I'll be saving hundreds of dollars by not ordering from you anymore in the future. I just threw your menu in the garbage as soon as I was done eating my roll. You screwed me by giving me close to en empty roll for a Turkey sandwich and now your wallet is going to be screwed by all the business you lose. You can't do that to customers because you will be the one to pay for it in the end when you go out of business!  Smarten up and do it right from now on!",

You can order online or on the phone, have it delivered or pickup, and your food will be fast and fresh. Their appetizers are pretty good, especially the combo appetizers.

          "text": "Decided to give this place a try tonight. Big mistake. Ordered a large cheese pizza for pickup, walked in to this janky shop that seemed to be half put together, only to find this clearly very miserable woman, and a man who was so stoned he seemed to be either on Mars or Pluto, I couldn't tell. But anyways, she comes over to the counter and asks my finace can I help you? Before I continue, every single time I have ordered a pizza in the 30 years of my existence, picking it up goes the same way. Walk in, say \"i placed an order for pickup\" and the waitress responds with either \"what did you have?\", \"phone number?\" Or \"name?\". Well the miserable, regretful waitress decides to do the hand rolling gesture to my fianc√© while making a face as if to make her seem stupid. A joke of an employee, and a joke of a pizza shop. The cheese is also clearly bagged and comes from a sysco truck. Years of working in a pizza shop where they use fresh ingredients and care about their customers is how I know. Save the 21 dollars for a cheese pizza and give it to a homeless man if you're considering ordering here. Now I see why they are bribing people with free food for a 5 star review. Most businesses earn their reviews. ü´°",

I looked inside and there were two or three very small thinly sliced pieces of Turkey. Barely anything! Very disappointed. Skimping on the meat is not good. You just lost my business. Charged me $25 for sandwiches that likely only cost them $6 to make. You need to make people a REAL sandwich! That means at least 6 slices of Turkey. I think subway gives people 12 slices of Turkey for a foot long sub! Take a lesson from them. You should be embasrassed. Oh well, I overspent with you, but I'm getting my money back. I'll be saving hundreds of dollars by not ordering from you anymore in the future. I just threw your menu in the garbage as soon as I was done eating my roll. You screwed me by giving me close to en empty roll for a Turkey sandwich and now your wallet is going to be screwed by all the business you lose. You can't do that to customers because you will be the one to pay for it in the end when you go out of business!  Smarten up and do it right from now on!",

The food is always delicious.\n\nThe reason it's lost a star since my last review is because even though I've twice paid for bacon on my sandwich, they continue to either put it on the wrong sandwich or not give it at all.\n\nThe longer this continues the further my rating will drop.

Their prices are fair, and the best part is that they are the only shop in Riverside open till 2am in the morning! So if you get a craving for pizza or a sub late, you can get your fix from them! You can order online or on the phone, have it delivered or pickup, and your food will be fast and fresh. Their appetizers are pretty good, especially the combo appetizers.

Ordered a large cheese pizza for pickup, walked in to this janky shop that seemed to be half put together, only to find this clearly very miserable woman, and a man who was so stoned he seemed to be either on Mars or Pluto, I couldn't tell. But anyways, she comes over to the counter and asks my finace can I help you? Before I continue, every single time I have ordered a pizza in the 30 years of my existence, picking it up goes the same way. Walk in, say \"i placed an order for pickup\" and the waitress responds with either \"what did you have?\", \"phone number?\" Or \"name?\". Well the miserable, regretful waitress decides to do the hand rolling gesture to my fianc√© while making a face as if to make her seem stupid. A joke of an employee, and a joke of a pizza shop. The cheese is also clearly bagged and comes from a sysco truck. Years of working in a pizza shop where they use fresh ingredients and care about their customers is how I know. Save the 21 dollars for a cheese pizza and give it to a homeless man if you're considering ordering here. Now I see why they are bribing people with free food for a 5 star review. Most businesses earn their reviews. ü´°",

I looked inside and there were two or three very small thinly sliced pieces of Turkey. Barely anything! Very disappointed. Skimping on the meat is not good. You just lost my business. Charged me $25 for sandwiches that likely only cost them $6 to make. You need to make people a REAL sandwich! That means at least 6 slices of Turkey. I think subway gives people 12 slices of Turkey for a foot long sub! Take a lesson from them. You should be embasrassed. Oh well, I overspent with you, but I'm getting my money back. I'll be saving hundreds of dollars by not ordering from you anymore in the future. I just threw your menu in the garbage as soon as I was done eating my roll. You screwed me by giving me close to en empty roll for a Turkey sandwich and now your wallet is going to be screwed by all the business you lose.
