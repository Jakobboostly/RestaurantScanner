Do not be dissuaded because it's connected to a gas station. They have so many great varieties of grilled cheese, it was hard to decide what to get. I settled on the BBQ brisket, and it was an excellent choice. The meat was so tender and loaded with plenty of gooey cheese. The bread was toasted to perfection. My son gave me a bite of his French dip, and it was just as good. For the side, I ordered the mac 'n' cheese, and it was possibly the best I've ever had, including the stuff I lovingly make at home on the smoker. Convinced yet? Just go!",

          "text": "First time trying Melty at the Lehi location while staying nearby. We came in Saturday night around 8:40pm after seeing nachos on the Google Maps photo menu‚Äîonly to find out they don‚Äôt actually serve nachos. Ended up ordering the Club Melt and the Turkey Avocado Melt, both as meal combos. The Club Melt was fantastic‚Äîthe mayo aioli really stood out. The Turkey Avocado Melt was decent, but not as flavorful.\n\nWe also added loaded fries, loaded tots, and a small mac & cheese. The bill for two came to $46, which felt pricey considering the portion sizes. The sides were especially underwhelming‚Äîvery small portions, and the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù topping tasted more like sauce with bacon crumbles and chives sprinkled on. The mac & cheese was okay but not worth $6 for such a small cup.\n\nThe sandwiches were a bit greasy coming out of the bag‚Äîbut that‚Äôs expected with grilled cheese. Overall, the Club Melt was the highlight, but the sides and pricing left us disappointed.",

One of the employees, a male with dark grey hair, was extremely rude and disrespectful toward me. Instead of being welcoming or helpful, his attitude came across as dismissive and unprofessional, which made me feel very uncomfortable as a customer.\n\nA place like this should pride itself not only on the food but also on the way they treat people, and unfortunately, that was completely lacking during my visit. I won‚Äôt be coming back, and I hope management takes this feedback seriously because no one should be treated that way when they‚Äôre just trying to enjoy a meal.",

We walked in about 30 mins before they closed but were still greeted warmly by Denise and Michael. The sandwiches were grilled to perfection and it was the perfect combo of salty and savory. We had the ham and cheese, French dip and the 4 cheese classics with tots. All of it was perfect. Nothing beats a crispy tot‚Ä¶ and these are a 10/10. Need some good comfort food? Look no further!",

Do not be dissuaded because it's connected to a gas station. They have so many great varieties of grilled cheese, it was hard to decide what to get. I settled on the BBQ brisket, and it was an excellent choice. The meat was so tender and loaded with plenty of gooey cheese. The bread was toasted to perfection. My son gave me a bite of his French dip, and it was just as good. For the side, I ordered the mac 'n' cheese, and it was possibly the best I've ever had, including the stuff I lovingly make at home on the smoker. Convinced yet? Just go!",

The cheese wasn‚Äôt melted nor was there a whole lot like you would expect based on the photos. The food was hot and the tater tots were delicious but overall the portion was really poor. The sandwich was very small. I‚Äôd go back in a pinch but I‚Äôd probably opt out for other area restaurants based on how small the food was for the price.",

So, without any real expectations, we ordered a couple different grilled cheese sandwiches: the 4 cheese classic and the pizza melt. Both of them were absolutely delicious! The restaurant had a nice vibe and we were able to find a quiet corner to chat while we ate. It was awesome!\n\nRight before we were done, one of the workers offered us a couple of cookies on the house. So nice of them and completely unexpected! That‚Äôs the kind of experience that sticks with you. These folks are great and the food speaks for itself. We‚Äôll be back!",

It was our first time at the restaurant, so the cashier recommended a couple sandwiches. We decided we would go with the chicken parm and the Cuban both in combos that came with tater tots and a drink.  We were not disappointed. The chicken parm had a good amount of a sauce with melty cheese and a fried chicken cutlet which covered the bread.  The sandwich also was not Wonder-bread small.  I was surprised that the sauce was not the overly sweet spaghetti sauce that most restaurants default to. It tasted true to an Italian restaurant.  The Cuban was amazing as well. There was smoked pork, ham, cheese, and pickles. It was better than the Cuban sandwich I had in Florida.  The toast was consistent on the bread and it was a nice golden brown. The tater tots were perfectly fried (crispy) and perfectly seasoned.Because my expectations were beyond met, we will definitely be back, and I won‚Äôt be surprised if I will return in my dreams as well, for the craveability factor is off the charts.",

We came in Saturday night around 8:40pm after seeing nachos on the Google Maps photo menu‚Äîonly to find out they don‚Äôt actually serve nachos. Ended up ordering the Club Melt and the Turkey Avocado Melt, both as meal combos. The Club Melt was fantastic‚Äîthe mayo aioli really stood out. The Turkey Avocado Melt was decent, but not as flavorful.\n\nWe also added loaded fries, loaded tots, and a small mac & cheese. The bill for two came to $46, which felt pricey considering the portion sizes. The sides were especially underwhelming‚Äîvery small portions, and the ‚Äúcheese‚Äù topping tasted more like sauce with bacon crumbles and chives sprinkled on. The mac & cheese was okay but not worth $6 for such a small cup.\n\nThe sandwiches were a bit greasy coming out of the bag‚Äîbut that‚Äôs expected with grilled cheese. Overall, the Club Melt was the highlight, but the sides and pricing left us disappointed.",

One of the employees, a male with dark grey hair, was extremely rude and disrespectful toward me. Instead of being welcoming or helpful, his attitude came across as dismissive and unprofessional, which made me feel very uncomfortable as a customer.\n\nA place like this should pride itself not only on the food but also on the way they treat people, and unfortunately, that was completely lacking during my visit. I won‚Äôt be coming back, and I hope management takes this feedback seriously because no one should be treated that way when they‚Äôre just trying to enjoy a meal.",
