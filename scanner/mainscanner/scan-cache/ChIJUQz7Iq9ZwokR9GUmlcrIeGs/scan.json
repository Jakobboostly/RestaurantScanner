She also tried one of their smoothies or juices of the day (can‚Äôt remember which one), but she liked it as well.\n\nPrices were very reasonable, and the service was friendly and efficient.

The dish features a crispy potato latke as the base, topped with beautifully smoked salmon, perfectly poached eggs, baby kale, and a rich hollandaise sauce. Every bite was packed with flavor and the textures were spot on ‚Äî it‚Äôs a must-try if you‚Äôre a fan of brunch classics with a twist.\n\nI also tried the Pan-Seared Fish Sandwich, and it was just as impressive. The fish was cooked to perfection ‚Äî crispy on the outside, tender and flaky inside. It came on a soft brioche bun with fresh arugula, pickled fennel, pickled red onion, and LTO, which added a nice tangy crunch that complemented the fish really well. You can tell they use high-quality ingredients and take pride in their preparation.\n\nWhat really made the experience even better was the service. The staff were incredibly helpful, attentive, and genuinely friendly. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also worth mentioning ‚Äî it‚Äôs clean, cozy, and very inviting. Whether you‚Äôre grabbing brunch with friends or looking for a relaxed place to enjoy a good meal, Friedmans hits all the right notes.\n\nHighly recommend checking this place out. I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next visit!",

They are know for their Pancakes and honestly it didn't disappoint. They was moist, fluffy and had good flavors. I prefer more crisp edges but still close to perfection for me. I enjoyed the Blueberries not so much the compose along with it.\nWe also had the Eggs with Style that comes with your choice of protein, potato Hash and Bread. The Eggs were really good. I was sketchy because they looked soft and I ordered scrambled hard. They was really good. My Hash was too hard to enjoy (I did request it crunchy but was over done).\nFood tasted really fresh, service was great and didn't wait long for the food!\nI find it a bit pricy for an Egg meal but at least we was satisfied!\nI recommend.",

          "text": "The \"famous\" french dip was a massive let down. Do yourself a favor and head to Salt Hank's. The roast beef sandwich was flavorless and dry, way too much unrendered fat. Worse than that - the au jus is bland in a criminal way. It tasted like high school cafeteria grade food. I will say the texture of the fries were really good - but they arrived at the table with half of the basket cold. I was a little shocked by the experience for a place that was absolutely packed for lunch. It's impressive to be served cold fries that were that crunchy, still. Despite that, 10/10 will not go back.",

We ordered the chicken chilaquiles, a breakfast burrito, and a side of tomato bisque. Everything arrived fresh and as described, but the flavors didn‚Äôt spark much excitement. The food felt more functional than memorable, leaning into consistency rather than creativity.\n\nGiven Friedman‚Äôs reputation and the buzz around its various locations, I expected something with a little more personality‚Äîsomething that would make it feel worth the hype. Instead, the experience felt more like a polished franchise than a neighborhood gem. Reliable? Absolutely. Special? Not so much.\n\nA good stop if you‚Äôre in the area and need a comfortable brunch option with solid service, but don‚Äôt expect it to linger in your memory after the meal.\n\n#HellsKitchenEats #NYCBrunch #FriedmansNYC #FoodReview",

Forse meno ‚Äúold school‚Äù di quanto ci aspettassimo, ma comunque piacevole.\nüç∞ Cheesecake cremosa e ben fatta.\nüç∫ Due birre IPA e una chiara, tutte ottime.\n\nüí∞ Spesa: 103$ in 3 persone, esclusa mancia.

I would have happily waited a few minutes for that. She also said there were no tables available, and didn't even ask if I would like to order to go. I kindly asked for a menu and she seemed bothered by that. As she handed me a menu a couple came in with no reservations and she lead them to a table. This interaction made me feel really unwelcome it was my very rude and unpleasant. When all I was trying to do was come on and peacefully enjoy (and pay for) a delicious gluten free. As a service worker I always tip well in appreciation of being treated like a human being.\nI can't see myself going there or recommending this restaurant.",

We ordered the chicken chilaquiles, a breakfast burrito, and a side of tomato bisque. Everything arrived fresh and as described, but the flavors didn‚Äôt spark much excitement. The food felt more functional than memorable, leaning into consistency rather than creativity.\n\nGiven Friedman‚Äôs reputation and the buzz around its various locations, I expected something with a little more personality‚Äîsomething that would make it feel worth the hype. Instead, the experience felt more like a polished franchise than a neighborhood gem. Reliable? Absolutely. Special? Not so much.\n\nA good stop if you‚Äôre in the area and need a comfortable brunch option with solid service, but don‚Äôt expect it to linger in your memory after the meal.\n\n#HellsKitchenEats #NYCBrunch #FriedmansNYC #FoodReview",

Worse than that - the au jus is bland in a criminal way. It tasted like high school cafeteria grade food. I will say the texture of the fries were really good - but they arrived at the table with half of the basket cold. I was a little shocked by the experience for a place that was absolutely packed for lunch. It's impressive to be served cold fries that were that crunchy, still.
