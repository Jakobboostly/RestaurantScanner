Always loved everything here especially their Italian beefs which were always huge. Since moving a little further I've  found them on UberEATS and have been getting Italian beefs the last 2 years (along with pizza etc.) .   I will say the Italian beefs are even better than they were years ago.  Don't know what you're doing but keep it up!.  To me.... this Italian beef is  in a class with some of the best  around Chicagoland and  that is saying something.  Update 8/24/25- another great beef from here.

Always loved everything here especially their Italian beefs which were always huge. Since moving a little further I've  found them on UberEATS and have been getting Italian beefs the last 2 years (along with pizza etc.) .   I will say the Italian beefs are even better than they were years ago.  Don't know what you're doing but keep it up!.  To me.... this Italian beef is  in a class with some of the best  around Chicagoland and  that is saying something.  Update 8/24/25- another great beef from here.   Do not  sleep on this place for IT. beef's!",

I understand I did not specifically ask for a well dine pizza, but my last interaction with the owner I was told they are all cooked well done.  They were good for a while,  but the last two times I ordered I have to say I am extremely disappointed.  The middle of the crust is barely cooked, just a flabby mess. The cheese is pure white, it should have some color.\nThe crust us what really gets me though, how can something that undercooked be sent out. 2 times in a row this happened,  I will never order from here again, I dont think there is any decent pizza place in des plaines to be honest. It's sad. I only gave it 2 stars because the chicken tenders were good but that's hard to screw up.",

Sometimes the bottom can be a little soggy; but this time it looks like somebody stuck their finger in the middle and played with the cheese after it came out. I was too hungry and didn't feel like going out to call and complain. I'll just check the pizza before waking out next time.",

Unfortunately we found pieces of cheese under the filling and this was not difficult to find as there was a good amount of cheese! I really don‚Äôt think it was an accident because of the way and amount of the cheese we found. We took some pictures and videos‚Ä¶\n\nI may be wrong about who made this pizza, but it seems to be a different person by the way it was organized and the different ingredients on the pizza because I had bought cheeseless veg pizza-gluten free for dinner before.\nBut today was the last time!",

I understand I did not specifically ask for a well dine pizza, but my last interaction with the owner I was told they are all cooked well done.  They were good for a while,  but the last two times I ordered I have to say I am extremely disappointed.  The middle of the crust is barely cooked, just a flabby mess. The cheese is pure white, it should have some color.\nThe crust us what really gets me though, how can something that undercooked be sent out. 2 times in a row this happened,  I will never order from here again, I dont think there is any decent pizza place in des plaines to be honest. It's sad. I only gave it 2 stars because the chicken tenders were good but that's hard to screw up.",
