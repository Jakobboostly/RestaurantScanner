          "text": "Major bummer. Last time we went to La Salita we watched the staff sneeze into the ice and scratch themselves. We told the manager and they gave us a gift card. We were hesitant to go back and waited about 4 months. Sad to say it‚Äôs gone down hill. We asked if the guacamole would be enough for a party of four, the young lady said yes the starter is ‚Äòfull size.‚Äô  The $5 guac under ‚Äòstarters‚Äô is served in a 2 ounce ramekin. When we asked to pay the difference and switch to queso as an app, the manager, Sara said, ‚ÄúIf you think this is small I can get you one half the size.‚Äù Great customer service. The queso was so watery more gets on the table than the chip. They didn‚Äôt drain the turkey so my enchiladas were swimming. My husband and father‚Äôs blue corn turkey enchilada plates didn‚Äôt have any turkey. It was a tortilla stacked a top another tortilla. My mom‚Äôs rellenos were burnt. I waited in line for 10 minutes while our family ate to order more beers, pay for them, then be told the tap was blown. One of the managers brought me the beer and said the staff didn‚Äôt know the handle was turned. Half our food was remade and by the time mine finally came back every one was finished. When I finally got my plate the manager stayed and talked for over 10 minutes. By then my egg was cold and rubbery and the whole experience was the pits. We used to go weekly and now it‚Äôs just over priced fast food at best. We threw all the leftovers away as my parents both reported being sick all night.",

When I arrived I was greeted very kindly and every staff member I interacted with during my visit was attentive, caring, and truly wonderful.\nI ordered a turkey enchilada with green and red sauce on the side as this was my first time trying the sauces. The food was good, but not great, which could just be me as I'm not from around here and my pallet isn't quite the same but I didn't like either of the chile sauces, there was way too much cheese on my enchilada and I was given 5 pieces of a diced tomato. The portion size was perfect and I didn't take home any leftovers.\nI'd say the atmosphere is good, but a little industrial feeling. The outside of the building isn't really inviting at all and there's a lot of open space and basic seating at basic tables throughout. I was comfortable, but it wasn't a 5 star experience.\nThey do have a very extensive list of awards won!",

It's also affordable for the quality and service you receive. Whether you're planning a graduation, birthday, family gathering, or baby shower- I highly recommend them. They have great food and drinks, as well as vegetarian and vegan options. Our guests loved the margaritas especially.\n\nHuge thanks to the La Salita team for helping make our celebration so memorable!",

          "text": "Major bummer. Last time we went to La Salita we watched the staff sneeze into the ice and scratch themselves. We told the manager and they gave us a gift card. We were hesitant to go back and waited about 4 months. Sad to say it‚Äôs gone down hill. We asked if the guacamole would be enough for a party of four, the young lady said yes the starter is ‚Äòfull size.‚Äô  The $5 guac under ‚Äòstarters‚Äô is served in a 2 ounce ramekin. When we asked to pay the difference and switch to queso as an app, the manager, Sara said, ‚ÄúIf you think this is small I can get you one half the size.‚Äù Great customer service. The queso was so watery more gets on the table than the chip. They didn‚Äôt drain the turkey so my enchiladas were swimming. My husband and father‚Äôs blue corn turkey enchilada plates didn‚Äôt have any turkey. It was a tortilla stacked a top another tortilla. My mom‚Äôs rellenos were burnt. I waited in line for 10 minutes while our family ate to order more beers, pay for them, then be told the tap was blown. One of the managers brought me the beer and said the staff didn‚Äôt know the handle was turned. Half our food was remade and by the time mine finally came back every one was finished. When I finally got my plate the manager stayed and talked for over 10 minutes. By then my egg was cold and rubbery and the whole experience was the pits. We used to go weekly and now it‚Äôs just over priced fast food at best. We threw all the leftovers away as my parents both reported being sick all night.",

          "text": "We hosted my graduation party at La Salita, and I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for their event space and support. From start to finish, the staff was helpful, responsive, and incredibly kind. The buffet was ready right on time, the food was delicious (everyone raved about it!), and the space had just the right energy‚Äîwarm, festive, and relaxed.\n\nLa Salita offers a private event space for up to 40 people, and it was perfect for our group. It's also affordable for the quality and service you receive. Whether you're planning a graduation, birthday, family gathering, or baby shower- I highly recommend them. They have great food and drinks, as well as vegetarian and vegan options. Our guests loved the margaritas especially.\n\nHuge thanks to the La Salita team for helping make our celebration so memorable!",

Staff was all really friendly and service was very quick.\nThe food, however, was really not good. The salsa that came with the chips was extremely bland and seemed to have been heated up, which was also off-putting.\nRed chile was very bland as well, and the relleno was so tough I couldn't cut through it. But for the meager two bites I fought to eat, it wasn't good, either. Rice was also bland. Beans were easily the most flavorful thing on the plate but I didn't spend $13 to only eat a side of refried beans.",

When I walked in, the girl behind the counter was less interested in helping me. No smile, no hello almost seemed like I was imposing by ordering at 7:30. I ordered  2 plates. Both had refried beans, and it looked like they were scraped from the bottom or sides of the pot. They were dry and cracked like they had been sitting out on the counter. Like I said, I never had bad service and never complained about the food. But this was bad.",

It's the only way I can describe it okay but when it came to the food I had the taco special excellent price it was very good I enjoyed my meal very much as for the service I had to get napkins myself I had to get the to-go boxes myself I had to track somebody down to get me a straw but other than that it was good Mexican üåÆ",

We were hesitant to go back and waited about 4 months. Sad to say it‚Äôs gone down hill. We asked if the guacamole would be enough for a party of four, the young lady said yes the starter is ‚Äòfull size.‚Äô  The $5 guac under ‚Äòstarters‚Äô is served in a 2 ounce ramekin. When we asked to pay the difference and switch to queso as an app, the manager, Sara said, ‚ÄúIf you think this is small I can get you one half the size.‚Äù Great customer service. The queso was so watery more gets on the table than the chip. They didn‚Äôt drain the turkey so my enchiladas were swimming. My husband and father‚Äôs blue corn turkey enchilada plates didn‚Äôt have any turkey. It was a tortilla stacked a top another tortilla. My mom‚Äôs rellenos were burnt. I waited in line for 10 minutes while our family ate to order more beers, pay for them, then be told the tap was blown. One of the managers brought me the beer and said the staff didn‚Äôt know the handle was turned. Half our food was remade and by the time mine finally came back every one was finished. When I finally got my plate the manager stayed and talked for over 10 minutes. By then my egg was cold and rubbery and the whole experience was the pits. We used to go weekly and now it‚Äôs just over priced fast food at best. We threw all the leftovers away as my parents both reported being sick all night.",
