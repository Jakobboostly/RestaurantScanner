As main course I had the steak tacos and Truffle fries which were excellent!! Our waitress was excellent. Very good vibes. We went early but I could see this restaurant/bar being really fun at night to have a drink and socialize.  Really cute outdoor space to sit too.",

The staff was spot on and their service was outstanding, as was the food.  We had our event in the front section and it felt private, but, also was so bright and open feeling .  I would highly recommend Harp and Fiddle for any private event.  Thank you for making the shower such a great day!  I will definitely be back for our next party!",
