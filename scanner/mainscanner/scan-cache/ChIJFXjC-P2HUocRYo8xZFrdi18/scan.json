Wings were decent- lemon pepper has no butter, or lemon juice to soak thru the skin of the wing and get to the chicken. So it is just lemon pepper and salt on the outside of the chicken.\n\n2. Lack of and medium, or mold sauce was weird. They only have a hot sauce that was decent, but no mild or medium was weird and frankly weird\n\n3. Thursday night: music on- football was on ravens vs bengals. Please put that audio on- or the Utah hockey club was on could have put that audio also on.\n\n4. The server we had I forgot her name because she only took our food and handed us the bill. Never once checked on us, refilled a drink, nor ask us how we liked our burnt chips.\n\nOverall this is the 3-4 time I have been here and I always always want to love this place but the food isn‚Äôt good, service sucks, and I will long for a sports place in Utah",

I've been going to Wing Nutz for over a decade, sometimes for two meals a day! The wait for your food, at any location, any time of day is between 15 and 150 minutes. Throw a dart. The quality is also completely random. My \"home\" location had one manager that got drunk and danced like a stripper on the bar. Then another manager tried (almost successfully!) to sleep with my girlfriend.\n\nSo why the 5-star review, you might ask!? Quite simply, this chain is my favorite train wreck to watch, and I want it to stay around as long as possible. It's continued existence already defies all logic and hopefully this review contributes to that end.\n\nCheers! :)",

We have been going to Wing Nutz for almost 15 years and it has been going downhill pretty steadily since 2020.\n\nThe last several times we‚Äôve been in, they‚Äôve been shortstaffed. The food has been decent to great, but the wait for food and a check was ridiculous. They discontinued some of our favorite sauces, and we haven‚Äôt been in probably 7-8 months.\n\nWe decided to give them another try, and it was a bad decision. It appeared that there was some kind of staff/family party going on. The kitchen and waitstaff were eating and drinking at the tables and then getting up and going into the kitchen and wandering behind the bar. Our waitress got our order wrong, we had to flag the staff repeatedly to get water and the check.\n\nThe tip of the iceberg was the domestic dispute that was taking place between what (I assume) were friends of the owner. The male was very loud and obviously under the influence with a bunch of small children at the table. His partner, also obviously under the influence, was wearing a swimsuit, a t-shirt, sunglasses, and nothing else (I mean, get it girl). They were having a wild time at the bar while everyone else was in a restaurant.\n\nAt some point the male got in their SUV with the two of them shouting at one another, she had the sense to get the children out of the car, and he sped off. Super cool of the owner/manager to let his friend drive off drunk/high whatever leaving his partner and kids behind. Owner/manager did spend about 30 minutes talking to her on the patio while one of the kids was sobbing in the restaurant and a kind adult friend was checking on her. And you know, no one manning the kitchen and the waitresses swapping stories instead of waiting on tables. Owner/manager also appeared to be drunk and/or extremely high. No big deal.\n\nIt appears (also based on recent comments) that the manager/owner doesn‚Äôt really care about anything except having parties with his friends. Will not be coming back. Am also hoping those kids make it home safe.",

I don't even know where to begin with it- but the behavior of the females working was ridiculous, two of them acted as if everything was a two person job and the other being all buddy-buddy with the cook. Not only that but vaping in the kitchen openly (I saw it, the disposable was a lime green color) and forgot my order two times. I was sitting with my grandfather and he got his food after around 30ish minutes while I had nothing. My soda wasn't even refilled while my grandpa had to flag down on of the servers/bartender to get him another beer. The service was just horrible and I would not go back there ever again. (The bartender who was vaping also pet a service dog that was on duty, and it's common courtesy to not pet service animals when they are working.)",

I had to go ask another server if they are able to charge me so we could leave that server just left the check on the cashier table and took even longer for us to pay for our food and get out of there.

I go into Wing nuts, the bar is full, turns out it's all employees or friends of. (not a welcoming environment). I sit down I have to wait 10 minutes before I get a waitress, I order my food of course not wings so everything I got was burnt, bacon super extra crispy and black. the Buffalo chips, burnt all around the edges and if you've ever eaten something that has burnt on it that's the only flavor you get. then I watched one of the employees (just guessing he is an employee because of what and how he did it). get up from the bar, walked to the back and begin eating pizza in the food service area, they don't serve pizza and big No-No eating in the food service area. said employee then goes and pour's a beer off the draft hands it to one of his friends or other employee sitting at the bar then walks around the bar and sits back down also big DABC violation. no name tag and a few other violations that would get there alcohol permit suspended and big fines. few other things I can mention but my essay is getting long so, basically horrible experience.Poor service, burnt food and just not a welcoming environment. it's about the employees and their friends and not about actual customers.",

          "text": "Always love this place. Roughly $10 gets you like 6 wings, a side salad, and a beer. Perfect for killing an hour and hanging out. Sauces are all excellent. Unfortunately, they are suffering from labor shortage issues as well. This visit, there were 5-6 empty tables, but we overheard the waitress saying that it was a 45 minute to 1 hour wait. We went elsewhere that night, but it has no impact on my view of Wing Nutz. Everyone is going through this. We haven't found a restaurant in the last 6 months that wasn't on a huge wait. Just a standard restaurant, nothing fancy, was a 3 hour wait a few weeks back. We'll go again, and we'll love it just as much as we always did! üòÅ",

The server was so bad, slow no sense of urgency  or a care at all. He was at the bar eating his wings right after taking our order was so nasty.  They only had 3 tables with us. The cook was slow and same thing no sense of urgency not prepared at all in the kitchen.  I don‚Äôt recommend this place.",

We were 2-3x a month diners.\nHowever, the last time we got boneless chicken wings the meat was rotten. It had smelled like something gross when we first walked in, now I realize it was rotten chicken smell and we should have left right then. Waitress was very apologetic. The waitresses and service has always been top noch here and it's not her fault.\nIt doesn't matter what the sell by date is, if the chicken smells rotten....... It IS rotten and just throw it away.\nSadly, we will never be back.",
