          "text": "My husband purchased and picked up 2-1 topping pizzas (1 pepperoni and 1 cheese) on Friday,  10.8.21 around 4pmish. On his way home, he decided to check the pizzas and told me to turn on the oven because the pizzas didn't look cooked. Oven turned on, I decided to try a slice of the pepperoni pizza with hopes it was thoroughly cooked through. The cheese was barely melted, but edible. As I neared the crust of the pizza, I gagged and spit it out immediately upon discovering the pizza dough was uncooked. As you can see in the pictures, nothing but sticky dough.\n\nI immediately called OBO and explained to the gentleman that the dough on the pepperoni pizza was raw.  He gave me the option to have the pizza cooked again,  but they were 20 pizzas behind and that it would take an hour or so before ours were done,  OR refund our money after the manager called us back.  I opted for a refund and gave him my name and number per the guy on the phone,  the manager would contact me within an hour. I took pictures and videos as proof and waited for a phone call... no one returned our call. We will take the \"L\" on our money this time,  but fair warning ‚ö†Ô∏è,  check your pizza at the store.  You may need to pull a slice out and eat it before you leave üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ.",

It doesn‚Äôt reheat the well in the microwave, although we did not try it in the oven which may make a difference.\n\nWe tried this place on a lazy Tuesday night and had a large pepperoni and personal ‚ÄúJuly special‚Äù pizza which was pepperoni with fresh tomatoes, and buffalo mozzarella - I added spinach and spicy sausage.\n\nWhile hot, these pizzas were really good. Toppings were fresh, crust and sauce have a nice flavor profile to them.\n\nWill try this place again and update this post. In the meantime, please do try them out for yourselves, customer service is friendly and prices are reasonable.  Although I think $13.99 for 10 wings is a bit high, I hope these are big wings.",

The pizza is good however a bit too much cheese and not firm enough for my taste, as I'm a plain cheese pizza type of guy. At OBO I request the pizza to be cooked crispy and not too much cheese. The end result is really really good! Customer service is always top notch and the rewards program is great. I'll continue supporting this local chain!",

The two young ladies that work the front counter were very friendly and attentive and the pizza maker did an excellent job making my pizza.  I ordered a veggie pizza both times and the pizza was cooked just right. Keep up the good work. The young adults working there do an amazing job.",

So while my sub \"steamed\" in its own juices, by the time I got home, 3, miles, it's was a wet soggy mess. Last time for me. Fries were good. Place is filthy. Surprised it's still in business.

We ordered online in the middle of moving.( You can't call in delivery). Our order was accepted and we were charged. The pizza didn't come so we called and the location didn't get our order. The manager called the other location to see if they had the order they didn't. We already paid for the pizza so we had to stop moving, and go figure out the issue. We showed the manager the payment and the credit card charge. And ultimately she gave us the pizza. But we lost an evening moving  decent pizza poor interface door dash does delivery. Id recommend only picking up in person.",

She was very rude both times. My family has been going to this place for years, and the service was always great. She rushes you off the phone, and sounds like she doesn‚Äôt want to be there. She just kept saying is that it, is that it or yup. My tip is, that you should hire someone who wants to be there, and treat your customers with respect. Even if you don‚Äôt want to be there, FAKE IT!  I will make sure to let everyone know about the type of service they will receive if they decide to come to this establishment. It‚Äôs such a shame how this place is now from what it was before. Absolutely rude and I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened! Or last time.",

          "text": "I ordered two cheesesteaks and some wings. Nothing and I mean nothing had any flavor. When I first picked it up, I couldn't even smell the food which made it a red flag from the jump. After attempting to consume it, it was too hot as there was too much hot relish, cheese was thick and not melted and the wings were terrible. The sandwiches were just thrown together as the ingredients weren't portioned well.  Although the cashier was friendly,  I can tell that no one working the grill love what they're doing. It tasted like it! What a waste of $40.00.",

          "text": "My husband purchased and picked up 2-1 topping pizzas (1 pepperoni and 1 cheese) on Friday,  10.8.21 around 4pmish. On his way home, he decided to check the pizzas and told me to turn on the oven because the pizzas didn't look cooked. Oven turned on, I decided to try a slice of the pepperoni pizza with hopes it was thoroughly cooked through. The cheese was barely melted, but edible. As I neared the crust of the pizza, I gagged and spit it out immediately upon discovering the pizza dough was uncooked. As you can see in the pictures, nothing but sticky dough.\n\nI immediately called OBO and explained to the gentleman that the dough on the pepperoni pizza was raw.  He gave me the option to have the pizza cooked again,  but they were 20 pizzas behind and that it would take an hour or so before ours were done,  OR refund our money after the manager called us back.  I opted for a refund and gave him my name and number per the guy on the phone,  the manager would contact me within an hour. I took pictures and videos as proof and waited for a phone call... no one returned our call. We will take the \"L\" on our money this time,  but fair warning ‚ö†Ô∏è,  check your pizza at the store.  You may need to pull a slice out and eat it before you leave üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ.",

We ordered online in the middle of moving.( You can't call in delivery). Our order was accepted and we were charged. The pizza didn't come so we called and the location didn't get our order. The manager called the other location to see if they had the order they didn't. We already paid for the pizza so we had to stop moving, and go figure out the issue. We showed the manager the payment and the credit card charge. And ultimately she gave us the pizza. But we lost an evening moving  decent pizza poor interface door dash does delivery. Id recommend only picking up in person.",
