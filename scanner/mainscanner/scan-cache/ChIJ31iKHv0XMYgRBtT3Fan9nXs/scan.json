Last week I went to pick up my pizza and because it was so big I went to put it through my door sideways into the car and the pizza fell out of the box on the ground. The guy at the register immediately told them to make me a new one and helped me clean it up. When I went to pay for the new pizza they said ‚Äúno worries‚Ä¶ accidents happen, enjoy your pizza‚Äù and didn‚Äôt let me pay for the new one. Super nice people and definitely did make my night!",

But I stopped there today and finally had a chance to try out his pizza..\n\nAnd let me tell you! Some of the best pizza I've ever had! I got the New Yorker, and I've legitimately never seen a bigger pizza, not in person at least.\n\nI've gotten to know the owner, and he seems to really care about his business, and clearly cares about his pizza, because it for sure shows in the quality of it! All of the ingredients tasted super fresh, and super tasty.\n\nI got the New Yorker with Pepperoni and Banana Peppers, my personal favorite combination. And I only made it through 2 slices!! 2!!\n\nThis pizza is worth every dime. It was not only tasty, but cooked to perfection. The toppings were plentiful, the dough was delicious, and the crust was so good(which many places fail at).\n\nEven though I'm rarely out in this area due to the distance, I'll surely be back to try more things on the menu!\n\nGlad to have met you! And glad to have finally tried the pizza! üòÅüçï\n\nThanks Mike!\n\nBTW.. The pic of the two slices on the tray, are on a normal extra large pizza tray. The slices are really that big!",

The pizza was fresh, cheese was edge-to edge and the large was enough to feed the family.  The 1lb wings were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.  The calzone was the best I‚Äôve ever had. It comes with 3 topping of your once.   The Buffalo quesadillas smelled and tasted delicious.  They support your local public  servants (police, firefighters and EMT).

          "text": "So glad to have discovered this place! Mind you, I discovered it through installing the epoxy floors there, because I actually live an hour away. But I stopped there today and finally had a chance to try out his pizza..\n\nAnd let me tell you! Some of the best pizza I've ever had! I got the New Yorker, and I've legitimately never seen a bigger pizza, not in person at least.\n\nI've gotten to know the owner, and he seems to really care about his business, and clearly cares about his pizza, because it for sure shows in the quality of it! All of the ingredients tasted super fresh, and super tasty.\n\nI got the New Yorker with Pepperoni and Banana Peppers, my personal favorite combination. And I only made it through 2 slices!! 2!!\n\nThis pizza is worth every dime. It was not only tasty, but cooked to perfection. The toppings were plentiful, the dough was delicious, and the crust was so good(which many places fail at).\n\nEven though I'm rarely out in this area due to the distance, I'll surely be back to try more things on the menu!\n\nGlad to have met you! And glad to have finally tried the pizza! üòÅüçï\n\nThanks Mike!\n\nBTW.. The pic of the two slices on the tray, are on a normal extra large pizza tray. The slices are really that big!",

We ordered a calzone also, and it just really blew us away how great it tasted!  The portion is amazing, the food is great, and it was served with a smile....boy, you certainly know when you are getting good customer service, and this is it....it's our new, favorite pizzeria!  Thanks SO much, Mikol, I appreciate what you do - keep up the good work...and cranking out the best pizzas in Aurora!",

The pizza was fresh, cheese was edge-to edge and the large was enough to feed the family.  The 1lb wings were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.  The calzone was the best I‚Äôve ever had. It comes with 3 topping of your once.   The Buffalo quesadillas smelled and tasted delicious.  They support your local public  servants (police, firefighters and EMT).

Some places when you order extra cheese then when you get it you wonder if they remembered to put on extra cheese or if you‚Äôve been had.\nThere was no question that my Uncle Spike‚Äôs pizza had extra cheese.  Thick and delicious!  The dough was fresh and delicious and for me it was just the right thickness.  Not too thick and not too thin.\nThe sauce I believe is an Uncle Spike‚Äôs original.  It‚Äôs tangy with just a tiny bit of sweetness.  Perfect\n\nI ordered the 14‚Äù pie which will leave a little left for breakfast tomorrow üòä\n\nThey make pizzas as large as 24‚Äù!  I saw the boxes!  How fun to order those for a party!  I saw a 20‚Äù they were sliding out of the oven and man did it look delicious!\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a chain pizzeria.  Expect to pay more because you‚Äôre getting quality.  And when you lift the pizza box it has heft - you know you‚Äôre paying for a great pizza experience!",

It‚Äôs an expensive pizza to be that disappointing.\n\nWings were so-so but the mild buffalo wings tasted more like a dry rub than a buffalo sauce. Garlic parmesan wings were slightly better.  They also forgot the two orders of blue cheese that I paid for.\n\nOn the plus side, the delivery was on time and pretty fast from time of order to time of delivery.",

It‚Äôs an expensive pizza to be that disappointing.\n\nWings were so-so but the mild buffalo wings tasted more like a dry rub than a buffalo sauce. Garlic parmesan wings were slightly better.  They also forgot the two orders of blue cheese that I paid for.\n\nOn the plus side, the delivery was on time and pretty fast from time of order to time of delivery.",
