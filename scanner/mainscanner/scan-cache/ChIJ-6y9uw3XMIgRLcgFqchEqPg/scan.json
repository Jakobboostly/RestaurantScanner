However within the past year, the quality/quantity of what comes on the Italian Sub has diminished significantly. This was, WAS our go to spot for the Italian Sub. The flavor is still fantastic but the amount of ingredients that go on it has drastically changed to almost non existent.  The pizzas are still fantastic but we will not be going here for subs anymore. My husband was told over a month ago that they did cut back on ingredients due to availability/cost. And the person he spoke to asked for us to please come back again. So we decided to order last night. My husband called it in and spoke to Renee when he ordered. He explained what happened with our prior experience and asked for plenty of lettuce, tomatoes and onion. She said that wouldn't be a problem. We get our subs and are yet again extremely disappointed. Like I stated above this has been our go to for \"The Italian Sub\" for many years.\nA friend of ours called in and spoke to Renee, while she was apologetic she said they weigh their proportions out to corporate standards.  If the below standard is their standard then they have lost us as customers.\nPlease do better!!",

I called the store to complain to the manager ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù, she stated that she would give us a credit for the pizzas because we were not about to be inconvenienced and have to drive all the way back to the store. So I called on 6/4 To use my credit and then she tells me it‚Äôs only a credit for one pizza instead of two. She gets rude and impatient yelling asking me if I‚Äôm gonna take the credit or not, and then hangs up the phone on me After I asked her for her managers number. She said that she‚Äôs a general manager after I asked to speak to a general manager immediately, How rude can one be. I‚Äôm sick of people in customer service being absolutely disrespectful. This is not someone who needs to be working at this store let alone claim she is a ‚Äúgeneral manager‚Äù we have spent a lot of money at this store and will not be back if she is still working here!!!!

A manager of a store should always set an example for others.. rather it‚Äôs good or bad! I will NEVER order food from this place again.

          "text": "Unbelievable terrible service. It's been 8 years since I've ordered from the Market st location and they just reminded me why. When I ordered they told me 20 min for pickup. I arrived at the 20 min mark and then waited 35 more minutes. Meanwhile my order was sitting on top of the oven. I asked multiple time the status and was dismissed. My order sat there getting cold for at least 20 minutes. It was ice cold by the time I got home. Rubbish.",

At 5:45pm I called the store and was told that the order was canceled because I placed the order for the wrong store. But, I did not, as the receipt listed the correct store. Then, when I told the person that the receipt showed that I placed the order at the correct store, she then said a man called and canceled the order. The worker also said something about the driver saying the order was canceled. So, I have no idea what they did or why she kept making up stories about the order being canceled. I have been charged $77 for this order and was told it will take up to 5-7 business days for a refund to go through.  In addition to the poor service, there is also a $4.99 delivery charge and an approximate $3.00 credit card charge added to the order, with an expected tip to be added for the driver also. You have permanently lost our business.",

The pan pizza has a nice, thick crust, with a good crunch on the bottom and a pillowy center; it usually has plenty of sauce and cheese, and they have really good prices for it ($12 for a large pepperoni!).  Their garlic cheese bread is a necessary addition, and get a bunch of marinara sauce to dip everything in, I would inject that stuff directly into my veins if I could.  The delivery guy is also the best guy ever, I swear he is always a joy to talk to.  If you're ordering pizza in Akron, get it from here, you will not be disappointed!",

The young man on the phone told me \"Ya know there's sauce on top of that\" to which I informed him that yes, that's what makes it a deep dish Chicago pizza.  He took my info then promptly hung up on me during mid sentence. When I picked up the pizza there were a few young kids in the open window kitchen just standing around and one girl was on her cell phone the whole time.  When I got home and looked at my pizza there was little to no sauce at all on top.  (It used to be covered in marinara and grated Parmesan cheese.  Since it was too late to return I begrudgingly ate a slice feeling very disappointed. I don't think I'll be going back there again. I should have just ordered from Romeo:s.  ...at least they know how to make a deep dish.",

Professional and polite staff who get the food done on time without the quality of their work suffering. I have been ordering pizza here for more than half a decade and it tastes the same every time.\nConsistently good food, punctual reliability, and the atmosphere inside projects cleanliness and tidiness. Been my #1 for several years, highly recommended.\nDon't forget; to ask about specials for a good deal, whether you're eating alone or feeding a family, you can count on a good meal from this place.",
