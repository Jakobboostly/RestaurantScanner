Please go for this place if you're in South City and want pizza delivery; teir pizza flavor, no matter the toppings, is still my personal favorite.\nI'll say this about my 3 star rating: the price of the food now is way too high for the style of food this place provides, and the dine in experience I had wasn't great.  I dined in with my partner and between the two of us our bill was a little over $50; we ordered a personal pepperoni pizza, a salad, one drink and an order of fried pickle chips. At the time, the place seemed understaffed, we had to seat ourselves, we didn't get refills on our drink, and the restaurant was honestly pretty dirty and had to approach the front counter and wait to receive and pay for our check. I understand that food prices are rising, but we dined in at a restaurant inthe Hill a week later for way better atmosphere, higher quality food, and enough staff to actually wait on us to get us refills and check on us for the same price. I'm sorry to the staff, and I'll still come back, but the Saint Charles locations seem to be in better shape and I'll still use this location for takeout or when their patio is open.",

Please go for this place if you're in South City and want pizza delivery; teir pizza flavor, no matter the toppings, is still my personal favorite.\nI'll say this about my 3 star rating: the price of the food now is way too high for the style of food this place provides, and the dine in experience I had wasn't great.  I dined in with my partner and between the two of us our bill was a little over $50; we ordered a personal pepperoni pizza, a salad, one drink and an order of fried pickle chips. At the time, the place seemed understaffed, we had to seat ourselves, we didn't get refills on our drink, and the restaurant was honestly pretty dirty and had to approach the front counter and wait to receive and pay for our check. I understand that food prices are rising, but we dined in at a restaurant inthe Hill a week later for way better atmosphere, higher quality food, and enough staff to actually wait on us to get us refills and check on us for the same price. I'm sorry to the staff, and I'll still come back, but the Saint Charles locations seem to be in better shape and I'll still use this location for takeout or when their patio is open.",
