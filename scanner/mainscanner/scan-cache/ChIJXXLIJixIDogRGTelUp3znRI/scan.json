We were the first ones in at opening and still waited over 90 minutes for our food (2 calzones, Margherita, Hawaiian no ham).\nThe Margherita arrived mostly raw. The Hawaiian first came with ham (we asked for none), and the remake was also undercooked. We were on a tight schedule after the ridiculous wait, so we asked for the raw Margherita off the bill ‚Äì no time for another remake. Then we asked for the bad Hawaiian off too.\nThe manager's response? \"Our pizzas can't be undercooked, they're timed.\" Unbelievable. They still made us pay for the poorly made pizza. The server was okay, but the manager was nasty and wouldn't budge.\nFirst and definitely last time at Salerno‚Äôs. Save yourself the trouble. Very disappointed",

Then am by a waitress that's curses about no pens in the front. And asks if I'd been helped. Only for her to walk away and say nothing else. Nor directed anyone to help me. Another waitress comes by and I ask if I could just order two slices. To which the other waitress comes by and says they have them but they've even there all day long. So I tell them I'll go else where. In which they had no reply. EXTREMELY unprofessional.",

My only complaint  is NEVER forget your credit card üí≥.  I had forgotten mine and the other day I called to see if it was there and instead of getting a yes or no answer they straight up accused me of being some one else that didn't pay their bill. They had me on hold and put me to a \"manager\" and even he was like weren't you the guy who didnt pay their tab. This was honestly pretty enfuriating because I had explained  to the first girl that picked up that they had me confused üòï. Why would I not pay and then go back for my credit card ????? Like where does that make any sense. To make it worse I was hungry and I contemplated getting something  to go but since I didn't even get an apology for the confusion  I went some where else.",

At 7:00 when it was ready after being told a half hour it would be ready we go and pick it up and it is a stuffed pizza with just cheese on it. We went inside asked for the manager he was like well maybe we have one in back did you want me to check? I was like well who's pizza is this then? He's like I have no idea? And just stood there looking at us like a dumb idiot that he is in my opinion .They are so incompetent at this restaurant it's unbelievable that they're still in business.See photo bathrooms are very dirty",

First we ordered calamari. Absolutely horrible. We picked it up and the breading fell off and we couldn't even chew it. Sent it back. Sausage and peppers were horrible. Asked for bread. Got a piece of bread you would make a sub sandwich with. Couldn't cut it with knives we had because they were dirty.  If that wasn't bad enough when we got the pizza one look at it and I was disappointed. Definitely not homemade. Looked like a frozen pizza. No taste. I can get a better pizza at Little Ceasers. Service was horrible as well. Get the bill and I'm charged $1.40 for a hospitality fee. What??? I was charged for something I didn't even get. Will never go back!!! Worst $50 I ever spent. Salernos pizza is dead and gone. üò≠ They need to take the name off that place because it is definitely NOT SLAERNOS.",

I decided tonight I'd take myself out on a date, and with the Groupon I paid for, I was able to get $50 worth of food and drinks for $30.\nThe atmosphere is so nice. The lights are relatively dim, the chairs and tables are higher up, and the music is pretty good. You can also control what music plays if you use the touchtunes app.\nThe servers were very helpful! I was struggling to hit the $50 mark on my own, which I think is a good thing. I started off with a Salerno's Punch, which was a delicious alcoholic drink. It was fruity and sweet enough to very slightly mask the taste of the Bacardi, but without being overkill.\nI had the pretzel sticks, which were so much bigger than I thought they'd be. The outside was slightly crispy and the inside was so fluffy and soft. The cheese sauce dip was perfect and had a subtle spice to it, which was delicious.\nNext I had the whiskey pulled pork burger, which was the most incredible thing I'd ever seen. Who thinks to put pulled pork on top of a burger? That's so clever to me. I was starting to get full after a few bites, and I was still drinking my second drink. Even after 2 drinks, pretzels, and a burger with fries, I still hadn't hit my $50 mark. So, I decided to get dessert. They recommended the chocolate cake. I'm not usually a huge fan of chocolate cake, but I'm finishing it right now at home. It's delicious. The little chocolate curls on the side are such a good addition! I've included a photo.\nAll in all, my experience was incredible and the food was delicious. I'm glad I took myself on a date here :)",

          "text": "-0 (Negative) Stars 12/07/24: Drove 40 minutes from the NW suburban area to be there for bands in back room -- Our table actually didn't get to order because of these issues caused by Salerno's\n1) the table that my friend reserved was given away, and Salerno's knows to who, but would not accept the fault and retake the table and seat the party I was with (Salerno's gave it to a party that was with the opening band. Salerno's put out a table for us)\n2) UNORGANIZED & UNSOPHISTICATED - Saturday night & during Christmas season & in proximity to a movie theater & other large retailers, but Salerno's was unprepared. 1 hostess, 1 backroom bartender, maybe 2 floor servers, 2 front bar bartenders (* will get back), and seemingly 2 or more servers & bartenders for what they consider a private party room (* will get back)\n3) Greed & 1 focus - $; the service was focused on the dining room floor & the party in the party room adjacent to the music room\nSalerno's divider of a private party room & the music room is what they believe are magic or soundproof curtains. The party was for someone turning 70. They might enjoy the music of Creed & Motley Cr√ºe, but they did not get a separate room because the curtains are merely dividers.\n3.a) The manager placed menus on our table but sent nobody over to serve us--entire time\n\nWe never ordered and we had to go to the front bar for cocktails (* get back)\n4) Front bar/Bartenders -- I AM A FORMER BARTENDER of the days when it was upstanding, had class, and the person knew how to mix cocktails, plus had a pleasant demeanor, AND had the training AND the WILLINGNESS, and knew laws about PROPER SERVICES TO EVERYONE  (* get back)\nWhite Male, 50s, grey hair, short cut, 5'9 or 5'10 ignored me and went to EVERYONE else around me, and NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED ME NOR TOOK MY ORDER. THERE IS SOMETHING BIAS, PREJUDICIAL, OR DEFINITELY FISHY IN THAT\nFemale bartender, short, dark with dark features like Italian or Latina, 20s/30s, EVENTUALLY, stopped at me & took my order, PARTIALLY. I told her Miller Lite & a Coke. She heard the beer just fine, but I had to repeat COKE! 3 times to a near SHOUT! She became offended, but failed to accept that she is offensive & offended the customer, me, by having me shout. Her attempted \"Prissy\" arrogant rudeness PAID OFF FOR ME. She NEVER came back with the pop, BUT she NEVER charged me for the beer, either - SCORE 3 for ME, the customer. I waited & I have a witness who that \"bar-person\" also NEVER SERVED THE POP. I walked away\n5) Back bar room: AWFUL! IT'S A PIT! mainly for service & customer-base. I do not mind a dive bar, when it suits its purpose & when I have made the choice to go. That Salerno's dresses it's fa√ßade as a middle scale restaurant, but it's a dump in a nice-looking building, from the outside. Eating at a dump is different than seeing a band and having a drink at a dive bar. I am pickier about food, but sometimes the best food comes from a seeming dump. I wouldn't know about Salerno's. We weren't served.  Changed my mind about eating there anyway\n6) Back Bar Bartender, \"Not!\" No \"Proper\" bartender nor restaurant training or service training. They just put a male behind the bar\n7) back bartender is worse than... ALL of them are equally bad, unskilled, untrained & bias, etc.\nHe works one end of the bar. He can't know what the other end of the bar would order because he doesn't get to that end, AND HE DOESN'T CARE. HE IGNORES FEMALES, & MAYBE THOSE NOT HIS TYPE.\n-- SALERNO'S STEALS $ - I WATCH & SEE. KEPT EYE ON REGISTER FOR BARS STEALING BY NOT HAVING SET DRINK PRICES & KEEPING CUSTOMER CHANGE COIN & BILL. BARTENDER NEVER RETURN COIN IN THE CHANGE of CASH\n- Near Closing: After allowing a separate drunk female & drunk male aggravate the band & he aggravated the female (FELL 3x) the bartender forced the older female with her female friend out the back door\n- Bartender & 3 others tackled the skinny (30s?) male--LAWSUIT, & forced him out back door\nSalerno's - OVER-SERVED, NON-ATTENTIVE TO CUSTOMER ACTION & BEHAVIOR, LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE & QUALITY etc.",
