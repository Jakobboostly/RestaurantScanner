They cost $5.50 and I was only given a hand full at best. The Pizza dough was also chewy and the green and red peppers I ordered were pretty much burnt. I also ordered onions and as you can see from the pizza it looks like there is only a small piece of onion on it. The pizza also can as a pan pizza which I did not order, unless that‚Äôs the only way they make their personal sized pizzas. If that is the case it should be advertised as such on the menu.  To make matters worse, this food cost me $24.61 which included a lemonade. This food was so bad., that I just received my order at 11:40pm and had to write a review right away. I couldn‚Äôt even eat it.\n\nI will not tell customers not to eat there because we all have different levels of expectations when it comes to food  and getting the value for the money. What I will advise is to patronize this establishment at your own risk. Note: This was a delivery order,",

          "text": "If I could give this food a zero I would. This food is disgusting, I ordered fries and personal pizza. The fires were chewy as if they had been microwaved and not cooked. They cost $5.50 and I was only given a hand full at best. The Pizza dough was also chewy and the green and red peppers I ordered were pretty much burnt. I also ordered onions and as you can see from the pizza it looks like there is only a small piece of onion on it. The pizza also can as a pan pizza which I did not order, unless that‚Äôs the only way they make their personal sized pizzas. If that is the case it should be advertised as such on the menu.  To make matters worse, this food cost me $24.61 which included a lemonade. This food was so bad., that I just received my order at 11:40pm and had to write a review right away. I couldn‚Äôt even eat it.\n\nI will not tell customers not to eat there because we all have different levels of expectations when it comes to food  and getting the value for the money.
