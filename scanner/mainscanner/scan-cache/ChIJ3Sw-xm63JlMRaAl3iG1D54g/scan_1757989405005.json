We did just their pepperoni and cheese for a kids party but we can't wait to try more flavors. 6 pizzas done in about 25 minutes and they are good sized too.  Will visit again!",

Ordered a jalapeno pineapple as my usual go to, not a fan of the crust but the pizza was nicely topped. (Once I added red pepper and Parmesan.) The lady delivery driver was very nice. Tried their jalapeno popper pizza yesterday and that was also good. Still meh on the crust but it was cooked well and quite tasty.\n\nAs I ordered delivery I can't say how the actual place is but will give it a try sometime!",

They left me on hold for 20 mins then said \"HELL NAW\" When the lady asked if the delivered where I am which again was 16.5 miles away from the pizza place in a rural area. The fact that they won't make a delivery 16 miles away is a joke and the way they speak to and about their customers while they are on hold(phone just layed on a desk so I can hear everything). This place will now never get my business. What a horrible experience with their customer service and the way their employees act.",

The pizza looked good.  It was hot. Definitely didn't have the \"double cheese\" i had asked for but I wasn't going to be picky.... Though that might have helped with keeping the toppings on... pizza shrapnel and lack of cheese aside... the crust on the bottom was soggy and undercooked.  The crust was tasty,  though... even if it wasn't completely sliced through...  Unfortunately,  as they didn't use a box liner, so that paired with the soggy underside that became glue by morning,  made 2/3 of the pizza very difficult to eat.\n\nThat said.  All the elements of a fantastic pizza were there... seemed to be quality ingredients and it tasted good.\n\nI'll give them another chance next time I'm through this part of ND and toss an update on here.",
