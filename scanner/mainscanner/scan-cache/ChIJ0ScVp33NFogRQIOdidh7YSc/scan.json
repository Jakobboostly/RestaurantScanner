Kids Mac n cheese is big enough to share!! Cheesy and flavorful. Lady was nice enough to put our 2yr olds in the freezer for a few to cool down. Also gave all 3 of our girls popsicles. Basket of garlic bread was also very too.\nWe got the chicken bacon ranch, chicken Alfredo and supreme pizzas. Everything was very tasty, cheesy and flavorful. Hope to stop again in the future...!!",

I called back they offered a remake but I was already home 15 mins away, so I declined and asked for a $10 credit. Employee said okay I can do that for you. So when I call to place an order and redeem my credit, I‚Äôm told that employee is not a manager and can not grant credits, not only that I‚Äôm told that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give out free food and their not giving me anything‚Äù. So not only am I being disrespected, but now made to look like I just want a freebie. Super weird behavior from the night shift manager KZ or whatever their name was. I solely order pizza from this place because it is peak and I love the service, but rn I‚Äôm not feeling the business I give is really appreciated. Which is very frustrating, I shouldn‚Äôt have to overly explain for the mistakes you guys made. It makes me uncomfortable and quite frankly it‚Äôs not customer satisfaction. I‚Äôve worked pizza, fast food, fine dining and I just wouldn‚Äôt treat people this way. Especially when you can see my reoccurring orders!",

Although my pizza was paid for and ready and sitting on the counter she made me wait until she helped another customer who was behind me although the pizza was 15 minutes late ( I ordered 1.5 hours in advance). She didn‚Äôt close the boxes all the way, I had to do myself. I was taking the pizza to a job site for a construction crew so I asked for the cheap paper plates they always give me and she went to the back to ask the guy if it was okay. I asked for some red pepper and parmesan and she said rudely she was only giving me 1 per pizza and would have to charge me for any extra. Wow, up until today their service has been good not as good as the SB location but nothing to complain about for sure.\n\nAlthough the pizza was delicious and everyone on the job-site enjoyed it, I will be visiting Barnaby‚Äôs next time I am working in the area and buying for  a the construction crew as she made sure I wasn‚Äôt welcome in her restaurant. Thanks.",

As I was waiting for my REMAKE of a steak and cheese from THIER MISTAKE from the previous day. I came back inside after the 10 minutes to see a child around 7 to 9 years old Bare Hands grab veggies out of the make table and dip it straight in the ranch on the make table!!! Gross. She looks straight at me I said she can't do that. The little girl ran to the back. The lady looked at me and said that's the owner's daughter you can't say that to her. I said that's disgusting and it's a health violation. I asked him if his employees were allowed to do that and he replied \" absolutely not\" then I said when why is she allowed to do that? The owner comes out grabs my food throws it straight in the trash. I never received my remake or my money then he called the police. So yes the food is decent but you never know who's little fingers are in there. So you got your own risk. I feel like they robbed me!!!!!",

Kids Mac n cheese is big enough to share!! Cheesy and flavorful. Lady was nice enough to put our 2yr olds in the freezer for a few to cool down. Also gave all 3 of our girls popsicles. Basket of garlic bread was also very too.\nWe got the chicken bacon ranch, chicken Alfredo and supreme pizzas. Everything was very tasty, cheesy and flavorful. Hope to stop again in the future...!!",

          "text": "I've gotten Halls Pizza numerous times but I've really only had one problem, and it was last night (6/7/2025). I walked in said I was here to pick up a paid for online order under my name, Robert. The guy at the counter grabs a pizza box and a foam container, which I thought was odd since I ordered 14 inch pepperoni and sausage and some cheesy breadsticks which normally both come in cardboard pizza boxes. He then opened the foam box and it was garlic bread. I just shrugged it off, their garlic bread is good, it's about the same price and I'd rather just get home. I asked for some paper plates and the guy helping said \"Sure, how do you want to pay?\". I've never had to pay for paper plates before but that Orange Chicken in office has kinda effed up the economy so not really all that surprising to be asked to pay a buck for them, I tell him card and he says you can go ahead and tap my card. I do so and I'm then show a screen saying I just paid $23! I immediately ask what did I just pay for and he said \"your order\". I then told the guy helping me, no that doesn't make sense, I paid for my food when I ordered using the Toast app. The guy got immediately argumentative saying that's my order it says my name on the receipt. I look at the receipt and the name showing is for a \"Roberta\" not a \"Robert\" and the order isn't even right (who the hell orders a pepperoni sausage pizza with nacho cheese sauce?). I reiterate explain thats not my name nor my order and the guy doubled down saying it was. No, dumba**, I know my own name, I've had it for 30+ years. I had to get my phone and pull up the toast app and show him my actual order receipt. The manager then comes over to see what's going on and I explain the issue, she looks at whatever kitchen management system they use and said they'll remake my order and refund the charge. I honestly should have just told them to refund me for both orders cause sitting and waiting for 10-15 minutes for them to remake my order just sucked. I finally got my pizza and when they handed it over they gave such an insincere \"sorry for the mix up\" it just pissed me off further. I won't be back anytime soon, which blows because the pizza and cheesy bread were actually quite good, but that service left an even worse taste in my mouth, and now I have to watch it make sure I actually do get a refund in 7-10 days ü§¨",

            "text": "I came in about a month ago to get a buffalo chicken pizza, when I got home the pizza was chicken and cheese, no onion, no bacon, aka not the pizza I ordered. I called back they offered a remake but I was already home 15 mins away, so I declined and asked for a $10 credit. Employee said okay I can do that for you. So when I call to place an order and redeem my credit, I‚Äôm told that employee is not a manager and can not grant credits, not only that I‚Äôm told that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give out free food and their not giving me anything‚Äù. So not only am I being disrespected, but now made to look like I just want a freebie. Super weird behavior from the night shift manager KZ or whatever their name was. I solely order pizza from this place because it is peak and I love the service, but rn I‚Äôm not feeling the business I give is really appreciated. Which is very frustrating, I shouldn‚Äôt have to overly explain for the mistakes you guys made. It makes me uncomfortable and quite frankly it‚Äôs not customer satisfaction. I‚Äôve worked pizza, fast food, fine dining and I just wouldn‚Äôt treat people this way. Especially when you can see my reoccurring orders!",

The wings are the worst Ive ever had it was rubbery like Tyson's chicken! Are we not gonna fry them at all? Im from out of state and this was worst 50$ Ive ever spent. Sad too cuz I wanted a go to out here.",
