          "text": "Great food. Don‚Äôt judge this place by its location; judge it by the amazing food because it is hands-down phenomenal, rich, and familiar all at the same time. It is so hard for us to find places with good North Indian flavors in the Frisco/Plano/Allen area but this place finally meets and SURPASSES all expectations! Plus, Indian AND Italian? Sign me up, I will ignore all my GI issues for this restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the Tropical Indian Pizza (mom wanted pineapples) and the Rigatoni Pasta (I wanted pasta). For the pizza, you can choose between Naan or Flatbread - we went with the Naan. The Executive Chef personally took our order and even accommodated all of our required substitutions (ordered minimal cheese on the pizza and that was accommodated to reduce my mom‚Äôs migraines). Huge plus!\n\nFood: 8.5/10\n\nThe pasta with halal chicken was superb. The naan-based pizza was flavorful, and the pineapples were juicy and well-balanced as part of the Tropical flavors. Personally, I prefer a thicker crust, so the thinness and hard crispiness of the naan pizza wasn‚Äôt quite to my liking ‚Äî the only reason this isn't a full 10. Also, I would have preferred a bit more spice in both dishes, but since this was my first time, I didn't know how spicey the original would be. Now I know what to customize for next time (pizza texture and spice levels).\n\nAmbience: 9/10\n\nWe came in during a quiet late afternoon, so we had the entire place to ourselves. That worked in our favor ‚Äî the Executive Chef had time to chat and share her inspiring journey in opening the restaurant and launching her catering business. The decor all around was very eye-catching and beautiful - there was a rhythm to the whole place, and the music in the background was also pleasant and not too loud as to be distracting. A memorable and meaningful experience - it was a lovely, illuminating conversation.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nCome hungry. Come curious. And come with an open mind. You will not leave disappointed ‚Äî In Sha Allah!",

We got the Chicken Tikka Naan Pizza and a large Veggie flatbread, both came out hot and fresh, which was awesome. The Chicken Tikka one had a really nice flavor, kind of spicy but not too much, and the naan crust made it super different (in a good way).\n\nThe service was great too. Our waitress was super nice and kept checking in to make sure we were good, which I appreciated. The decor inside was nice, not too fancy, but definitely clean and put together.\n\nAlso, the prices were actually decent, especially compared to other spots that serve fusion style food like this.

The Chicken Tikka one had a really nice flavor, kind of spicy but not too much, and the naan crust made it super different (in a good way).\n\nThe service was great too. Our waitress was super nice and kept checking in to make sure we were good, which I appreciated. The decor inside was nice, not too fancy, but definitely clean and put together.\n\nAlso, the prices were actually decent, especially compared to other spots that serve fusion style food like this.

          "text": "Great food. Don‚Äôt judge this place by its location; judge it by the amazing food because it is hands-down phenomenal, rich, and familiar all at the same time. It is so hard for us to find places with good North Indian flavors in the Frisco/Plano/Allen area but this place finally meets and SURPASSES all expectations! Plus, Indian AND Italian? Sign me up, I will ignore all my GI issues for this restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the Tropical Indian Pizza (mom wanted pineapples) and the Rigatoni Pasta (I wanted pasta). For the pizza, you can choose between Naan or Flatbread - we went with the Naan. The Executive Chef personally took our order and even accommodated all of our required substitutions (ordered minimal cheese on the pizza and that was accommodated to reduce my mom‚Äôs migraines). Huge plus!\n\nFood: 8.5/10\n\nThe pasta with halal chicken was superb. The naan-based pizza was flavorful, and the pineapples were juicy and well-balanced as part of the Tropical flavors. Personally, I prefer a thicker crust, so the thinness and hard crispiness of the naan pizza wasn‚Äôt quite to my liking ‚Äî the only reason this isn't a full 10. Also, I would have preferred a bit more spice in both dishes, but since this was my first time, I didn't know how spicey the original would be. Now I know what to customize for next time (pizza texture and spice levels).\n\nAmbience: 9/10\n\nWe came in during a quiet late afternoon, so we had the entire place to ourselves. That worked in our favor ‚Äî the Executive Chef had time to chat and share her inspiring journey in opening the restaurant and launching her catering business. The decor all around was very eye-catching and beautiful - there was a rhythm to the whole place, and the music in the background was also pleasant and not too loud as to be distracting. A memorable and meaningful experience - it was a lovely, illuminating conversation.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nCome hungry. Come curious. And come with an open mind. You will not leave disappointed ‚Äî In Sha Allah!",

For the price with this quality I would have expected bigger portions at least. Over $40 for two very mediocre, bland pizzas.\n\nMaybe their other food is good but pizza is right in their name and if they can't do that well, I wouldn't bet on it. I was looking forward to the fusion and they're super local, but sadly this is a hard pass.",

I only wanted to try a quick bite before we left the parking lot, but... well, we accidentally ate the whole thing on the way home. This is something special! The butter chicken pizza was amazing... I keep thinking about it, hours later. It's way off our typical routes, but we'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!",

We tried the Tropical Chicken Pizza, Butter Chicken Pizza, Tikka Tikka Wings, and Meatball Chicken Sandwich. All were really good but if I had to recommend a dish it would have to be the Tropical chicken pizza. It was a great blend of flavors and really delicious! The chef/owner came out to talk to us and told us the story of how Far East Pizza came to be, she was very personable! If you‚Äôre in Allen and want to try something new I would definitely recommend supporting them!",

The Tikka Tikka Chicken Wings were a hit, with their smoky and spicy kick leaving a lasting impression. Chef Nidhi‚Äôs Butter Chicken Curry was a highlight, featuring a delectable, buttery sauce that paired perfectly with the naan. Don‚Äôt miss the Ice Cream Bu√±uelo for dessert‚Äîa unique and indulgent treat. Wash it all down with the refreshing Pomegranate Lemonade.

            "text": "Maybe if the pizza was half price it would stand out\n\nMediocre quality ingredients, nothing special about the taste or texture of either the pepperoni or tikka pizza we had. For the price with this quality I would have expected bigger portions at least. Over $40 for two very mediocre, bland pizzas.\n\nMaybe their other food is good but pizza is right in their name and if they can't do that well, I wouldn't bet on it. I was looking forward to the fusion and they're super local, but sadly this is a hard pass.",
