I placed a late order for 15 people, and they still accommodated us without issue. The staff was friendly, the location was clean, and I really appreciated that each meal was boxed individually.\n\nTheir team is extremely courteous, and the entire experience was seamless. The food was hot, fresh, and prepared right on time, not too early or too late, so we were able to enjoy it while it was still perfectly hot back at the office.\n\nAs for the food itself, 10/10. The spice levels range from no spice to hot, so everyone had options, and the fries were delicious. Their lemonades were also a big hit. Overall, amazing service, great food, and a perfect spot for both individual meals and work events. Highly recommend!",

The staff was friendly, the location was clean, and I really appreciated that each meal was boxed individually.\n\nTheir team is extremely courteous, and the entire experience was seamless. The food was hot, fresh, and prepared right on time, not too early or too late, so we were able to enjoy it while it was still perfectly hot back at the office.\n\nAs for the food itself, 10/10.
