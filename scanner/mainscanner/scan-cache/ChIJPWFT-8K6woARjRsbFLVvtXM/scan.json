I‚Äôve been coming here for years and sometimes it‚Äôs anywhere from good to great not always great but the brisket I must say was absolutely as good as you can get and I grew up in Texas.\n\nI‚Äôll also say that the price point wasn‚Äôt terrible while it‚Äôs not as reasonable as I wanted to be it‚Äôs still in terms of Los Angeles prices it‚Äôs fair I suppose in his new era of higher prices lol",

Normally, it is hard to find a good bbq place but boy was I surprised by this place. The service was great. 3 different people approached me to take my order before I decided on what to get. I chose to e 1/2 pound chicken, Mac and cheese, collard greens, potato salad and beans along with some tropical punch Kool-Aid. Where can you get that these days? Ty r food was very well seasoned and the chicken had a great smoke taste to it. The best was by far the collard greens. They tasted like my grandmother was in the kitchen making them. This place didn‚Äôt disappoint at all. I will definitely be going back there. If you want some good food along with a cozy atmosphere, this is definitely the place for you.",

Food is about a 3.5-3.7, as I ordered Memphis ribs which were not tender and quite dry. I let the waitress know, but I decided to just eat what was on the plate not to waste that food. Collard greens were good, nothing stood out, stewed with tomatoes, Mac n cheese seemed bland to some degree. As others mentioned, the cornbread is the standout item. My waitress was exceptional and the vibe is cool. Not sure if I‚Äôd go back for ribs. Price is about on par with other bbq spots, $29 for the plate. Think my Dr Pepper was $4.50? That‚Äôs insane. The key lime pie was good $7.",

Let me say, I was a huge Baby Blues fan from back in the day but this was the absolute worst BBQ  I ever had in my life,  hands down.  The catfish was blah,  pulled pork dry, brisket was actually closer to jerky than to brisket, and the ribs were tasteless.  I have no axe to grind, no vendetta, but when I spend $100 for 1 person,  it better be good. I looked at there hours and they do close at 9pm...I ordered probably close to 8:45pm, but that shouldn't have any bearing on my order and if it is going to effect the quality,  don't take the order. Sending this garbage out was a terrible decision.  So disappointing.",

Let me say, I was a huge Baby Blues fan from back in the day but this was the absolute worst BBQ  I ever had in my life,  hands down.  The catfish was blah,  pulled pork dry, brisket was actually closer to jerky than to brisket, and the ribs were tasteless.  I have no axe to grind, no vendetta, but when I spend $100 for 1 person,  it better be good. I looked at there hours and they do close at 9pm...I ordered probably close to 8:45pm, but that shouldn't have any bearing on my order and if it is going to effect the quality,  don't take the order. Sending this garbage out was a terrible decision.  So disappointing.",

Let me say, I was a huge Baby Blues fan from back in the day but this was the absolute worst BBQ  I ever had in my life,  hands down.  The catfish was blah,  pulled pork dry, brisket was actually closer to jerky than to brisket, and the ribs were tasteless.  I have no axe to grind, no vendetta, but when I spend $100 for 1 person,  it better be good. I looked at there hours and they do close at 9pm...I ordered probably close to 8:45pm, but that shouldn't have any bearing on my order and if it is going to effect the quality,  don't take the order. Sending this garbage out was a terrible decision.  So disappointing.",

In Los Angeles it‚Äôs hard to find good quality barbecue and I must say I was so impressed with what I had at Baby blues. I‚Äôve been coming here for years and sometimes it‚Äôs anywhere from good to great not always great but the brisket I must say was absolutely as good as you can get and I grew up in Texas.\n\nI‚Äôll also say that the price point wasn‚Äôt terrible while it‚Äôs not as reasonable as I wanted to be it‚Äôs still in terms of Los Angeles prices it‚Äôs fair I suppose in his new era of higher prices lol",

Prices are reasonable considering meat prices and you get a lot of food.\n\nThe people are all so cool, especially Andrea. She's been our server forever and she's the best!

Normally, it is hard to find a good bbq place but boy was I surprised by this place. The service was great. 3 different people approached me to take my order before I decided on what to get. I chose to e 1/2 pound chicken, Mac and cheese, collard greens, potato salad and beans along with some tropical punch Kool-Aid. Where can you get that these days? Ty r food was very well seasoned and the chicken had a great smoke taste to it. The best was by far the collard greens. They tasted like my grandmother was in the kitchen making them. This place didn‚Äôt disappoint at all. I will definitely be going back there. If you want some good food along with a cozy atmosphere, this is definitely the place for you.",

Food was on point - large portions & good flavor. Only complaint there was it could have been a bit warmer, but not a huge deal. The hush puppies and cornbread were phenomenal, tons of corn flavor and texture and the honey butter was a great addition. There was a nice variety of very tasty bbq sauces right at the table so you can make your taste experience your own. The music was a bit loud to have conversation but also not a deal breaker. We‚Äôd absolutely return again!",

          "text": "As soon as I rolled into Baby Blue's Barbecue, the mouthwatering aroma wrapped around me like a cozy blanket, promising a feast fit for a king‚Äîand boy, did it deliver! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and when it arrived, my eyes widened in sheer delight. The bun was soft yet sturdy, cradling a generous heap of succulent, slow-smoked pulled pork that was so tender it practically melted in my mouth. Each bite was a glorious explosion of flavor, seasoned to perfection with a secret blend of spices that danced on my taste buds like a joyous jig. But let me tell you about those collard greens! Oh, sweet mercy! Cooked low and slow with just the right amount of smokiness and a hint of vinegar, they were so tender they nearly caved in to my eager fork. I savored every forkful, letting the rich, savory goodness linger as I gleefully plowed through my meal, feeling like a happy bear in a honey pot. I waddled out of there, my heart full and my stomach gloriously satisfied, already dreaming of my next indulgent visit to this BBQ paradise. Baby Blue‚Äôs is an absolute must for anyone like me who loves to embrace life one delicious bite at a time! As a disabled man (550-ish lbs) this restaurant was extremely accessible from a pragmatic stance. Highly recommend for all my plus-sized friends!\n\nLukewarm Regards - Humphry",

          "text": "I had the baby back ribs with pork & beans and potato salad, my wife had the Memphis style ribs, stewed tomatoes, potato salad and cornbread. It was my first visit since they resumed business after their fire and shutdown. The cornbread and the ribs were every bit as good as I remember from the pre-fire period.\n\nI managed to eat half my half rack, the corn bread, and perhaps a quarter of the pork & beans and one spoon full of potato salad. The reason? The portions are huge. I have NEVER been able to eat the ribs, two sides and cornbread in a single sitting.\n\nThe prices have gone up a bit from the pre-fire menu, but so has food in general. It's not cheap, but it is still VERY much worth it. I'll get at least two full meals and a snack out of it (my wife will likely get three full meals out of her order).\n\nThe ONLY regret I have is that the Texas beef rib is no longer on the menu (it was my wife's favorite). If they make ANY change to their menu, I would ask that they consider adding the Texas beef rib back on to the menu.\n\nBe prepared for a HUGE pile of food, all of it delicious. Go, dine-in or take-out, you'll be very happy with the result -- though you may be stuffed to the gills when you're finished.",

The catfish was blah,  pulled pork dry, brisket was actually closer to jerky than to brisket, and the ribs were tasteless.  I have no axe to grind, no vendetta, but when I spend $100 for 1 person,  it better be good. I looked at there hours and they do close at 9pm...I ordered probably close to 8:45pm, but that shouldn't have any bearing on my order and if it is going to effect the quality,  don't take the order. Sending this garbage out was a terrible decision.  So disappointing.",
