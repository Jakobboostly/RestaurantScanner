I‚Äôve never had an out-and-out BAD sub from Victoria‚Äôs (mediocre, yes. Good, yes.) until TODAY!  I got a roast beef sub today that was absolutely not worth the money! It won‚Äôt make you sick, but please don‚Äôt order it. It‚Äôs very brown. Very thick. Very stringy.  Not at all the thinly sliced, succulent pink roast beef you‚Äôre craving (and expect!) In addition there was not a lot of meat on the roll. (Although the meat was so off putting, I guess in the end that was a good thing) Just stick with pizza or an Italian sub when you come here. An absolute NO on the roast beef! (Here‚Äôs a photo of half my sub - I‚Äôd regrettably just eaten the first half) I paid $11 for a small and this was it‚Ä¶ yikes!!!)",

I really enjoyed the apple walnut salad that I got it was delicious and I will for sure be ordering it again. We also ordered the thanksgiving turkey sub and that was really good as well. The delivery time was good they told me an hour but it was here before then and the delivery driver guy was very pleasant and I made sure he was tipped well too. Overall I would say that they are a good staple to have in town again and it's great  that they are so local to me for when I want to order out or just looking to get something quick. Definitely give them a try! Thanks Victoria's Sub and Pizza for the delicious food and service.",

Google states that the restaurant closes at 9PM and I received a phone call at 8:10PM saying they were closing and that we had to come get our food. My husband arrived at 8:15 PM and the entrance lights were off and it was clear that we were ‚Äúinconveniencing‚Äù staff when they rushed our food to us. Do not treat customers this way when a shop clearly states in multiple places that it doesn‚Äôt close for another 45 minutes. To add insult to injury, two of our slices were completely inedible as they shoved our pizza into a box that was too small and the pizza was completely folded over on itself. When you‚Äôre paying $40 for mozzarella sticks and one pizza, I feel we‚Äôre deserved just a tad bit more respect. Very disappointed with new changes.",

I‚Äôve never had an out-and-out BAD sub from Victoria‚Äôs (mediocre, yes. Good, yes.) until TODAY!  I got a roast beef sub today that was absolutely not worth the money! It won‚Äôt make you sick, but please don‚Äôt order it. It‚Äôs very brown. Very thick. Very stringy.  Not at all the thinly sliced, succulent pink roast beef you‚Äôre craving (and expect!) In addition there was not a lot of meat on the roll. (Although the meat was so off putting, I guess in the end that was a good thing) Just stick with pizza or an Italian sub when you come here. An absolute NO on the roast beef! (Here‚Äôs a photo of half my sub - I‚Äôd regrettably just eaten the first half) I paid $11 for a small and this was it‚Ä¶ yikes!!!)",

I‚Äôve never had an out-and-out BAD sub from Victoria‚Äôs (mediocre, yes. Good, yes.) until TODAY!  I got a roast beef sub today that was absolutely not worth the money! It won‚Äôt make you sick, but please don‚Äôt order it. It‚Äôs very brown. Very thick. Very stringy.  Not at all the thinly sliced, succulent pink roast beef you‚Äôre craving (and expect!) In addition there was not a lot of meat on the roll. (Although the meat was so off putting, I guess in the end that was a good thing) Just stick with pizza or an Italian sub when you come here. An absolute NO on the roast beef! (Here‚Äôs a photo of half my sub - I‚Äôd regrettably just eaten the first half) I paid $11 for a small and this was it‚Ä¶ yikes!!!)",
