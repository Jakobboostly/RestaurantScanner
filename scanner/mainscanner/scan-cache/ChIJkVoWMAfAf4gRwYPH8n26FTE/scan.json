          "text": "Okay. Let me preface this with a couple of full disclosures. 1. I honestly know which food items to which I am allergic and I actively avoid those items. 2. My elders instilled amazing home training within me.  Having said this, let's get into it.  Upon arrival, we were stunned with the full parking lot of this little gem hidden off the road in MS and even more stunned by the check-out that was snaking around the entrance that was causing the wait to actually enter to restaurant.  Right! So, after a short wait,  we were seated and then greeted by the most friendly persons: Betsy and Lisa...amazing! We were told the buffet was actually the best bang for our buck and we accepted. This is when it got wonky! The only true vegetable/healthy option was iceberg only option  & minimal topping salad bar. But it was fresh and tasty, so üòã! Then I was off to the hot line...mistake! This is where I witnessed an older male patron using the SAME tongs to retrieve various items along the line. People!! What you do at home is your business! Cross contamination is real! And for those of us who are allergic to shell fish, this is a game changer. I instantly stopped filling my plate and found out waitress. Thankfully, she understood and acted swiftly. Although the utensils weren't replaced on the hot line, they did allow me to order whatever foods and, however, often to be cooked upon request.  This really fixed what would have been a disaster. Yes, I carry my Epi-pen, but who wants to get stuck bc someone else is too lazy to use multiple utensils!! Thankfully, Betsy and Lisa understood and acted swiftly to ease a difficult situation.\n\nThe only drawback is the lack of healthy options. As previously mentioned, there's only the lettuce and the boiled corn. The hot line consisted mostly of fried foods. There were a couple of pasta options but with the rolling 1 utensil guy on the opposite side, I declined to try them.",

          "text": "Okay. Let me preface this with a couple of full disclosures. 1. I honestly know which food items to which I am allergic and I actively avoid those items. 2. My elders instilled amazing home training within me.  Having said this, let's get into it.  Upon arrival, we were stunned with the full parking lot of this little gem hidden off the road in MS and even more stunned by the check-out that was snaking around the entrance that was causing the wait to actually enter to restaurant.  Right! So, after a short wait,  we were seated and then greeted by the most friendly persons: Betsy and Lisa...amazing! We were told the buffet was actually the best bang for our buck and we accepted. This is when it got wonky! The only true vegetable/healthy option was iceberg only option  & minimal topping salad bar. But it was fresh and tasty, so üòã! Then I was off to the hot line...mistake! This is where I witnessed an older male patron using the SAME tongs to retrieve various items along the line. People!! What you do at home is your business! Cross contamination is real! And for those of us who are allergic to shell fish, this is a game changer. I instantly stopped filling my plate and found out waitress. Thankfully, she understood and acted swiftly. Although the utensils weren't replaced on the hot line, they did allow me to order whatever foods and, however, often to be cooked upon request.  This really fixed what would have been a disaster. Yes, I carry my Epi-pen, but who wants to get stuck bc someone else is too lazy to use multiple utensils!! Thankfully, Betsy and Lisa understood and acted swiftly to ease a difficult situation.\n\nThe only drawback is the lack of healthy options. As previously mentioned, there's only the lettuce and the boiled corn. The hot line consisted mostly of fried foods. There were a couple of pasta options but with the rolling 1 utensil guy on the opposite side, I declined to try them.",

They are only open Thursday, Friday, Saturday. I love the fact that I am a travel business owner and I get the opportunity to do Market Research to spread the good news about the service and food quality.",

And the Hush Puppies were fresh and crispy on the outside full of flavor of a different kind on the inside. I recommend this place for when you are hungry and think you could eat a boatload of fish.",

Really packed at opening time on the Saturday I visited and I would recommend arriving about 6:30 as the first wave is leaving. This place is huge so don‚Äôt let the crowds deter you.  There is a constant turnover.  Try and save some room for cobblers and ice cream. Enjoy.",

            "text": "Okay. Let me preface this with a couple of full disclosures. 1. I honestly know which food items to which I am allergic and I actively avoid those items. 2. My elders instilled amazing home training within me.  Having said this, let's get into it.  Upon arrival, we were stunned with the full parking lot of this little gem hidden off the road in MS and even more stunned by the check-out that was snaking around the entrance that was causing the wait to actually enter to restaurant.  Right! So, after a short wait,  we were seated and then greeted by the most friendly persons: Betsy and Lisa...amazing! We were told the buffet was actually the best bang for our buck and we accepted. This is when it got wonky! The only true vegetable/healthy option was iceberg only option  & minimal topping salad bar. But it was fresh and tasty, so üòã! Then I was off to the hot line...mistake! This is where I witnessed an older male patron using the SAME tongs to retrieve various items along the line. People!! What you do at home is your business! Cross contamination is real! And for those of us who are allergic to shell fish, this is a game changer. I instantly stopped filling my plate and found out waitress. Thankfully, she understood and acted swiftly. Although the utensils weren't replaced on the hot line, they did allow me to order whatever foods and, however, often to be cooked upon request.  This really fixed what would have been a disaster. Yes, I carry my Epi-pen, but who wants to get stuck bc someone else is too lazy to use multiple utensils!! Thankfully, Betsy and Lisa understood and acted swiftly to ease a difficult situation.\n\nThe only drawback is the lack of healthy options. As previously mentioned, there's only the lettuce and the boiled corn. The hot line consisted mostly of fried foods. There were a couple of pasta options but with the rolling 1 utensil guy on the opposite side, I declined to try them.",
