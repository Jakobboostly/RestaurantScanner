My pizza was hot and super tasty. I think it was perfect actually. Just the right amount of sauce/cheese, the dough was ideal size and especially the crust, which was cooked just right with small burnt ends.. yummy. The price was so reasonable. I liked the staff a lot. Most importantly, the guy who made my pizza is amazing. I‚Äôm coming back because of him. He rocks that oven and makes the pizza fresh right there. The place was spotless. On a side note, there was a confusion on an order with another guest regarding her vegan meal. I would like to give compliments to the manager who was sincere with her situation and remedied it fairly and quickly. She was happy when she left. Great Italian pizza joint on the Southwest side of town that I highly recommend‚Ä¶.",

I ate two slices (okay fine, they were huge‚Äîprobably four slices in disguise) and didn‚Äôt spiral into shame afterward.\n\nThe crust? Perfection. The kind that makes you want to eat the pizza backwards just to enjoy it more. The gyro toppings were fresh and delicious‚Ä¶could‚Äôve used a bit more meat, but honestly, still delicious.\n\nTwo 16‚Äù pizzas fed our family of four and only three slices survived. RIP.

I didn't notice this until I got home and when I called, they said they can't give a refund or do much about it until the manager comes in the next day. I didn't know if I would get my refund and I didn't want to risk it so I spend 40 minutes going back and getting the right salad. This means that I come home to cold food, which isn't great tasting. Will update if my experience is better next time.\n\nUpdate: After going another few times, I realized that I enjoy coming here but my best experiences are during the day. Super friendly staff, great food that's consistent, excellent experience overall. My complaints come later at night where the owners or manager isn't there. But overall, I'm enjoying going here and will continue to update my review.\n\nUpdate 2: Been another few times. Dropping stars back down. I went and decided to get their four slices and a drink combo for $7.99 as shown on their TV menu, but they rang me up at $9.99 plus service charge and tax. I inquired as to why it was wrong and they just said their menu was wrong and that it was $9.99. A couple of weeks later their menu is still incorrect. Today, I picked up two large cheese pizzas to bring home. Came home and found out neither of them were sliced at all so I decided to downgrade my review back to where it was.",

I was debating to drive across town to check out a place that I saw online, but then I remembered about Martinos behind Rhodes Ranch. I looked on yelp and saw that I left a review there 3 years ago stating that the pizza was really good. I told myself that I‚Äôm going to eat there again today, and see if it‚Äôs still as good as a review that I left before. The pizza was absolutely phenomenal, and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier with my choice. The toppings don‚Äôt fall off the pizza when you bite it. I got the gluten-free option and that was really really good. Overall, I was completely happy, and this is definitely my new pizza place from now on.",

I agree with the other reviews that the quality has gone downhill. The wings were burnt and super salty. The garlic knots were not cooked properly. They looked like they were just thrown on the griddle and flipped a couple of times. They were doughy; they were not soft and fluffy like they usually are. Both pizzas I ordered didn't taste right; I couldn't put my finger on it. Perhaps the ingredients weren't fresh. And I don't recall them using fried chicken on their BBQ pizza (could be just me as I haven't ordered a BBQ pizza in a while). It sucks because they are so close to my house and have always been our go-to for pizza.",

Though we‚Äôve had issues now and then(the first pizza we ordered wasn‚Äôt sliced), we‚Äôve kept going back because the quality of food was great.\n\nHowever, the last 4 or 5 times we‚Äôve picked up orders, ingredients have been missing from the pizzas, freshness seems to have gone downhill and overall food quality has dropped.\n\nThis was by far our favorite pizza place in town for a while, now we‚Äôll probably only go back if we really don‚Äôt feel like driving somewhere more consistent with quality.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWe have tried a lot of pizza places all over Vegas, and Martino's is by far our favorite. Living with a New Yorker, she's got a high standard for pizza and we kissed a lot of toads, pizza wise, before we found her Prince in Martino's.\n\nThe Bee Sting is by far our favorite pizza. The crust is perfect, sauce is delicious and everything is fresh. They do amazing salads and cannolis too.\n\nMartino's is the only place we order Pizza from anymore.",

That consistency was brought on by the service and the food being absolutely amazing. They're seemingly on a decline. Of the past few orders, when I ask for my chicken extra crispy, it's hit or miss if they make it the way I asked versus it being perfect each time before. That's not the main issue. The issue is my most recent visit. Got the notification pulling up that my order was ready but got made to wait when I walked in, even after being made to wait my bread is cold and the chicken is barely cooked through. The most egregious part of this experience to me is the guy at the front. I've complained about his trash attitude, and was told that I wasn't the first to complain about him. Not only does he still work there but he's at the front when I walk in and gives me more attitude about the amount of ketchup packets I asked for. \"Do you really need that much?\" No but that's what I asked for so you need to learn to act right.  I don't know if they changed owners or what, but the consistency of integrity went out the window. Better off going to Dominos at this point. You all know EXACTLY who I am and how to reach me, but I won't hold my breath.\n\nI'd also like to point out, it was EXTREMELY bad form to just stop taking phone calls all together.",

I agree with the other reviews that the quality has gone downhill. The wings were burnt and super salty. The garlic knots were not cooked properly. They looked like they were just thrown on the griddle and flipped a couple of times. They were doughy; they were not soft and fluffy like they usually are. Both pizzas I ordered didn't taste right; I couldn't put my finger on it. Perhaps the ingredients weren't fresh. And I don't recall them using fried chicken on their BBQ pizza (could be just me as I haven't ordered a BBQ pizza in a while). It sucks because they are so close to my house and have always been our go-to for pizza.",

I didn't notice this until I got home and when I called, they said they can't give a refund or do much about it until the manager comes in the next day. I didn't know if I would get my refund and I didn't want to risk it so I spend 40 minutes going back and getting the right salad. This means that I come home to cold food, which isn't great tasting. Will update if my experience is better next time.\n\nUpdate: After going another few times, I realized that I enjoy coming here but my best experiences are during the day. Super friendly staff, great food that's consistent, excellent experience overall. My complaints come later at night where the owners or manager isn't there. But overall, I'm enjoying going here and will continue to update my review.\n\nUpdate 2: Been another few times. Dropping stars back down. I went and decided to get their four slices and a drink combo for $7.99 as shown on their TV menu, but they rang me up at $9.99 plus service charge and tax. I inquired as to why it was wrong and they just said their menu was wrong and that it was $9.99. A couple of weeks later their menu is still incorrect. Today, I picked up two large cheese pizzas to bring home. Came home and found out neither of them were sliced at all so I decided to downgrade my review back to where it was.",
