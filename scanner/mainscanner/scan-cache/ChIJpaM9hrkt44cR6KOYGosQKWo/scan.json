          "text": "My family and I have been to a couple of Happy Joe‚Äôs in Dubuque, but it had been several years since our last visit. While we were driving through the area, we decided to stop for lunch.\n\nOf the locations we‚Äôve been to, this is our favorite. We like the atmosphere and the general look, like a bit of a carnival feel. It‚Äôs fun, and frequently during your meal, you‚Äôll hear a honking noise, which we‚Äôve come to learn means someone is celebrating a birthday. And often, the other patrons join in signing a round of ‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù\n\nThe pizza is good with plenty of toppings. We ordered the lunch special, which includes a personal pizza and a soft drink, for $8. The great benefit is that you can order the pizza any way you want, so load up!\n\nService is fairly quick, and the lunch crowd didn‚Äôt seem overly packed, so we had plenty of space to sit. The parking lot is large, so you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem finding a space.\n\nThey ask for cash, but I do believe they accept credit and debit cards. If I heard right, it‚Äôs an extra $1 to pay that way.\n\nWe‚Äôve also had sandwiches there in the past, and some of those show up as a daily lunch special, which features something different Monday through Friday.\n\nAt the front of the restaurant, they also offer some ice cream and candy in case you need to fill in the space around your pizza after dinner.\n\nIf you‚Äôve never been to a Happy Joe‚Äôs, I‚Äôd suggest checking it out. And if you‚Äôre in Dubuque, see if you can stop by this location.",

          "text": "I had to drive to Dubuque, 2 hours away from where I live. It was the closest place where I could find a part I needed for my vehicle. When looking at the map, I just saw this place nearby and I thought, I have got to try that! My name is Joe so I thought that's cool. Then when I saw the pictures on the reviews, there's something called the \"Taco Joe\". I happen to work at Taco Bell and one of my nicknames is Taco Joe. I thought, no way! I need to go here if for no other reason than to get pictures to show my boss.\n\n. We got a Taco Joe pizza and a couple of drinks. The pizza was absolutely the best I probably have ever had as far as taco pizza is concerned. It was so delicious! The gentleman who took my order was super friendly and helpful, answered a few questions I had since it was my first time there. My girlfriend and I very much enjoyed the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolutely amazing. High energy, just a fun, friendly feeling in the air. Apparently it's kind of a family/kids type place. Twice while we were there, birthdays were announced and the entire restaurant was asked to sing happy birthday to the birthday people. The first was a young guy, maybe late teens or early 20s, the second was a 4 year old girl. Their respective waitresses tooted loud horns to get our attention and made the announcement and request to sing, and most of us did. It was pretty fun!\n\nThe men's room was very clean. I didn't have my 2 year old granddaughter with me this day, but it was nice to see that if I had, and she needed a diaper change, there is a changing station in the men's room. That's becoming more common overall, but many independent restaurants like this one still haven't added them to men's rooms so it's always nice to see.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here again. I don't care if I have to come alone, I need to try other menu items. I said my granddaughter is 2, but technically she will be 2 in January. Perhaps I'll try talking her parents into celebrating it here. That way I can introduce this place to several more people at the same time. If not, I'll still be back.\n\nSince I've seen many replies to reviews from the restaurant folks, I know you read these. I want to say thank you so much for your friendliness, excellent food, clean facilities, and for just providing an overall amazing experience! Despite being somewhat busy the day we were here, our waitress was prompt with our food and our one drink refill. And she was friendly like everyone else. It's been a few days and my memory sucks, but I want to say her name is Angela maybe? Or something similar. I'm so sorry. Anyway, I appreciate her service despite my memory. üôÇüôÇüôÇ",

She helped us with ordering and she made us up a Smores ice cream sundea which was delicious. She boxed our pizza up so it will fit in our hotel frig.

          "text": "I had to drive to Dubuque, 2 hours away from where I live. It was the closest place where I could find a part I needed for my vehicle. When looking at the map, I just saw this place nearby and I thought, I have got to try that! My name is Joe so I thought that's cool. Then when I saw the pictures on the reviews, there's something called the \"Taco Joe\". I happen to work at Taco Bell and one of my nicknames is Taco Joe. I thought, no way! I need to go here if for no other reason than to get pictures to show my boss.\n\n. We got a Taco Joe pizza and a couple of drinks. The pizza was absolutely the best I probably have ever had as far as taco pizza is concerned. It was so delicious! The gentleman who took my order was super friendly and helpful, answered a few questions I had since it was my first time there. My girlfriend and I very much enjoyed the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolutely amazing. High energy, just a fun, friendly feeling in the air. Apparently it's kind of a family/kids type place. Twice while we were there, birthdays were announced and the entire restaurant was asked to sing happy birthday to the birthday people. The first was a young guy, maybe late teens or early 20s, the second was a 4 year old girl. Their respective waitresses tooted loud horns to get our attention and made the announcement and request to sing, and most of us did. It was pretty fun!\n\nThe men's room was very clean. I didn't have my 2 year old granddaughter with me this day, but it was nice to see that if I had, and she needed a diaper change, there is a changing station in the men's room. That's becoming more common overall, but many independent restaurants like this one still haven't added them to men's rooms so it's always nice to see.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here again. I don't care if I have to come alone, I need to try other menu items. I said my granddaughter is 2, but technically she will be 2 in January. Perhaps I'll try talking her parents into celebrating it here. That way I can introduce this place to several more people at the same time. If not, I'll still be back.\n\nSince I've seen many replies to reviews from the restaurant folks, I know you read these. I want to say thank you so much for your friendliness, excellent food, clean facilities, and for just providing an overall amazing experience! Despite being somewhat busy the day we were here, our waitress was prompt with our food and our one drink refill. And she was friendly like everyone else. It's been a few days and my memory sucks, but I want to say her name is Angela maybe? Or something similar. I'm so sorry. Anyway, I appreciate her service despite my memory. üôÇüôÇüôÇ",
