They menu said they had cilantro lime dressing, but there was only plain cream and some brown guacamole-like substance. It was all so sadly bland.  The tortillas were cold from a package, not even warmed on the grill! The bulk of it was coleslaw. $15 for packaged coleslaw in a cold tortilla.  The kids‚Äô burgers were big, but again we had to ask for things like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, ketchup‚Ä¶ standard burger stuff you would think would be included.  Nothing felt like a whole meal. Be prepared for JUST Mac and cheese, no sides or flourishes. JUST a burger patty between a bun. We ate at many other much better places in the area.",

( we also didn‚Äôt eat more then one bite before we asked to have it done the way we ordered. The steaks they sent out to replace were just unfortunately full of tendons and one was grey.

Nothing to write home or even post about to be honest.  It is a golf course bar in a small blue collar town that serves food.  The food here is too much of a promise for the grill and not enough on follow-through.  Save your money and eat elsewhere.  This is a better place if you golf and just drink.",

The tortillas were cold from a package, not even warmed on the grill! The bulk of it was coleslaw. $15 for packaged coleslaw in a cold tortilla.  The kids‚Äô burgers were big, but again we had to ask for things like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, ketchup‚Ä¶ standard burger stuff you would think would be included.

On to the bad my Boyfriend and I both ordered the sirloin med rare and same sides, our steaks first came med well and well done. ( we also didn‚Äôt eat more then one bite before we asked to have it done the way we ordered. The steaks they sent out to replace were just unfortunately full of tendons and one was grey. We got to go boxes paid the full bill plus just shy of twenty percent tip because again the service was great, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll ever come again because it just was not worth 28 dollars a steak.",

They menu said they had cilantro lime dressing, but there was only plain cream and some brown guacamole-like substance. It was all so sadly bland.  The tortillas were cold from a package, not even warmed on the grill! The bulk of it was coleslaw. $15 for packaged coleslaw in a cold tortilla.  The kids‚Äô burgers were big, but again we had to ask for things like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, ketchup‚Ä¶ standard burger stuff you would think would be included.  Nothing felt like a whole meal. Be prepared for JUST Mac and cheese, no sides or flourishes. JUST a burger patty between a bun. We ate at many other much better places in the area.",

The food here is too much of a promise for the grill and not enough on follow-through.  Save your money and eat elsewhere.  This is a better place if you golf and just drink.",

Had good conversations with the bar tender and the waitress.\n\nThe drinks: some of the best brandy old fashioneds we've had! (and it's our go to everywhere)\n\nThe food: the food was excellent! The salmon Alfredo rivaled a dish i had in France. The prime rib sandwich was excellent, too! Highly recommend both options. We were both very happy with our choices and will order both again next time we come in.\n\nThe atmosphere: it was a quiet evening, an hour or so prior to closing. It was quiet and friendly. I'm sure with or without the house being packed, we would have the same wonderful fast service! The bartender (with great hair) and the waitress (with the wonderful smile) were fantastic and made the night a great experience!\n\n(only addition i would recommend to the establishment is adding a new special - could be once a month - with two salmon types on the same alfredo plate - the current salmon plus some smoked salmon and a little extra parm - then you'll beat the dish I had in France!)",

We walked in, and there was no hostess, but the girl behind the bar told us to sit anywhere. There was a wait before we were able to order and we found out that the bartender was having to cover both, but we each ordered a bloody mary, and I had the Philly sandwich and onion rings my wife had the alfredo. The drinks came, and I have to say that it was in the top 3 worst Bloody Mary's I have ever had. Just plain tomato juice and vodka. Needless to say, we didn't have high expectations for the food. Our order came out, and I was pleasantly surprised. My sandwich was huge, and the onion rings were really good. My wife raved about the alfredo sauce and still says that it was the best she has tasted. The atmosphere was kind of lacking. It had that we just opened kind of feel like they tossed some booths against the wall and set up some tables.",

Weather was beatiful and there was empty seats outside with a great view. We asked for a table outside, and we got a table inside, at least I could see my friends. I felt like they wanted to get rid of us fast. I got a fastfood feeling. The bill came before we finished our food, and when we finished our food and left there still was empty outside.",

When we asked if someone could help us we were told, \"I don't know who is supposed to have that section, but it isn't me.\". Usually this is a good place to go, but this time was very very disappointing\n\nUpdate:  so we have come back s few times since the original post.  Mostly, experiences have been good.  But tonight, we hit a new low sadly.\n\nOrdered the 10 oz sirloin, asked for it to be rare.  I'm attaching a pic of it, but at best, this is medium well.  And, this was their second attempt and the manager said \"we are not doing it again because we don't know how to cook it that way.\". Really?!\n\nIf you go here, order the cheese curds, the swedish meatballs, or wait for the prime rib special.  Don't get the steak unless you like hockey puck cooking.",

Highly recommend the crab stuffed mushrooms and the cheese curd burger.  Also, the portions were generous.  We ordered an extra side of asparagus each, but could have easily split one, and the charge was very reasonable for this extra side.  We will definitely eat here again when we are in the area.

The items I've ordered off the menu have been pretty good; Not great, but slightly better than average for this area.\nMy last visit, I had the soup & salad bar. Halfway through eating  my salad, I noticed a large clump of mud on my lettuce (ewww), so I showed the server and she went to the kitchen to tell them. Upon returning, she said they would check the salad bar...\nI was seated directly facing the salad bar and nobody ever did come check it. Not only that, no manager came over to apologize and no comp was offered. This place is now off my go to list :(",

He was very charismatic and knowledgeable of the menu and also offered us a fun treat after our meal.  We asked him for recommendations which were amazing like the shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer.  We got the ribeye to split with a side of wild mushrooms and loaded tator tots.  The steak alone was one of the best steaks we ate in our entire life!  Grilled perfectly to the medium-rare which we requested.   We loved the atmosphere.  It could be as formal or casual as you wished.  It was a beautiful setting on the golf course with beautiful views of the setting sun overlooking Chequamegon Bay.  I also liked the private booth we were seated in which made a wonderful evening for me and my wife.  A plus all around!  Great job to all that made our evening special!",

The tortillas were cold from a package, not even warmed on the grill! The bulk of it was coleslaw. $15 for packaged coleslaw in a cold tortilla.  The kids‚Äô burgers were big, but again we had to ask for things like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, ketchup‚Ä¶ standard burger stuff you would think would be included.
