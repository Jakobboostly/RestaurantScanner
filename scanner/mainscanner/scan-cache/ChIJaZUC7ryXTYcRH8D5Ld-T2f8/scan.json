Tons of seating indoors and outdoors on their patio with a lot of tables, padded seating, and tons of space.\n\nWe got the panini chicken, black burger, and chipotle burrito. ~$40 total. Not really worth it.\n\nThe black burgers bun was very dense and the patty didn‚Äôt have much flavor. The fries were pretty good but nothing special. We got the panini half chicken and half steak which was awesome that they did that for us. The steak side was way better than the chicken side that was a little dry and flavorless. The chipotle burrito wasn‚Äôt the best and even after bringing it home for leftovers it wasn‚Äôt finished and ended up in the trash.\n\nI think the positive reviews may be skewed since it‚Äôs in a college place, or the menu items we tried were just bland that day.",

          "text": "Our visit to Fresko had us hopeful, given its high reviews. The restaurant's cozy ambiance and welcoming staff set the stage for what we anticipated to be a delightful evening. However, our excitement quickly dissipated once our meals arrived. Despite the restaurant's high ratings, the food failed to impress. My request for a well-done burger without tomatoes was overlooked, resulting in a practically rare patty with unwanted toppings. The burger was so poorly cooked that it had a jelly-like consistency, and it was so bad that I had to spit it out. Adding to the disappointment, my girlfriend's ribs were cold. It's puzzling how the online reviews could have been so off the mark with this place. While the atmosphere and service were commendable, the lackluster food left us very disappointed that we just spent $40 for a bad meal.",

The staff was friendly and attentive, and was the best part of our experience. A place we would go back to on occasion for some good made-from-scratch comfort food. One thing to note, the chairs aren't great, so if you prefer more comfortable seating as you dine, make sure you grab a bench seat or order takeout. ;)",

Tons of seating indoors and outdoors on their patio with a lot of tables, padded seating, and tons of space.\n\nWe got the panini chicken, black burger, and chipotle burrito. ~$40 total. Not really worth it.\n\nThe black burgers bun was very dense and the patty didn‚Äôt have much flavor. The fries were pretty good but nothing special. We got the panini half chicken and half steak which was awesome that they did that for us. The steak side was way better than the chicken side that was a little dry and flavorless. The chipotle burrito wasn‚Äôt the best and even after bringing it home for leftovers it wasn‚Äôt finished and ended up in the trash.\n\nI think the positive reviews may be skewed since it‚Äôs in a college place, or the menu items we tried were just bland that day.",
