I came to Dan Kelly's anticipating, and ultimately getting, a party of about thirty people joining me. Considering that staff had no warning that this level of intensity was coming to the establishment, they, and especially Laurel, did a fantastic job of managing sporadic orders, making sure the correct people got the correct orders, keeping track of the exact items, and ensuring no detail was forgotten. I cannot recommend them enough, and Laurel deserves a Nobel Prize for keeping up with the insanity. Oh yeah, and the food was delicious, even as cold leftovers. Thanks, Dan Kelly's!",

Only qualm is this: the place was busy but not insane from the service industry worker point of view.  The bar seats were not full and there were a handful of tables open, for example.  There were 3 bartenders behind the bar,  and we waited for 10-15 minutes for a thc drink and 2 of the special shots that were highlighted on the chalkboard above the bar.  With 3 bartenders,  space at the bar itself,  open tables  and we wait 10-15 minutes? Get your staff up to snuff and teach them to hustle a bit more. More money for the business and more money for them! Thanks! PS- love the secret peephole. Lol. Also,  yay pulltabs!",

They told me that they \"messed up\" the order and would not deliver any pizza.  I asked for a refund.  They said no.  I asked to talk to a manager, who told me I could get gift cards but no refund.  I paid the $80.  They kept it.  They did not deliver any pizza.  My credit card company did end up reversing the charges when I called in to report the fraud. Stay away from this business.
