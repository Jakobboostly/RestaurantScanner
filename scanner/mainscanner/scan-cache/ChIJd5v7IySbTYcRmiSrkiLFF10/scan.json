When we called the employee spoke to the manager which approved free wings next time we ordered and they promised to write our name down.\n\nWell we called to place an order a week or 2 after they had messed up our older order hoping we could get what we were promised but when I explained the situation to the employee they placed us on hold so many times and finally when we spoke to a manger they said our name was not written down and said they could not give us the free wings because it was the 24 piece. We didn‚Äôt argue, and decided to not place an order that day.\n\nThey could really improve on their service because it‚Äôs definitely not it.",

More than 10 minutes after the expected time we had to ask the cashier for an update. The food had been ready, but it wasn‚Äôt brought out to us and we had no notifications in the app or otherwise.\n\nThe place was clean so no complains there. We enjoyed dining in and watching a bit of the game while we ate our pizzas. The pizzas themselves were okay, but not great.
