Everything tasted great, but this is definitely more food than 2 people can eat. Needless to say, we had quite a bit of leftovers since we didn't know that it would be large portions that they gave. They do have other food besides pizza, like spaghetti, meatballs, etc. I would definitely visit this pizza place again.",

I am highly disappointed. Our order was promised in 20min and took 30. The hostess is unfriendly. We asked to order to go. She thought we had a pickup order and just pointed us to the bar. We had to ask where  the menus are. The appetizer was sad. The Parmesan bites were dough puffs of air lightly sprinkled with Parmesan. They were so dissatisfying. The ‚Äúgrilled chicken‚Äù is pulled chicken; it looks like it‚Äôs from a can and doesn‚Äôt taste much better. After taking a bite, the entire toppings slid off of the pizza. The crust is bland and flavorless. It wasn‚Äôt worth it. I lost my appetite. I wouldn‚Äôt order here again and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to others.",

Everything tasted great, but this is definitely more food than 2 people can eat. Needless to say, we had quite a bit of leftovers since we didn't know that it would be large portions that they gave. They do have other food besides pizza, like spaghetti, meatballs, etc. I would definitely visit this pizza place again.",

We had to ask where  the menus are. The appetizer was sad. The Parmesan bites were dough puffs of air lightly sprinkled with Parmesan. They were so dissatisfying. The ‚Äúgrilled chicken‚Äù is pulled chicken; it looks like it‚Äôs from a can and doesn‚Äôt taste much better. After taking a bite, the entire toppings slid off of the pizza.
