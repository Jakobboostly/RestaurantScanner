This place has great vibes and a fun menu with great tacos!\n\nI ordered the Gringo and the Hot Chick. Both were great. The gringo was loaded with brisket and yummy toppings, I would order it again. The hot chick was a unique flavor combo with the corn tortilla, fried chicken, and the hot honey. It wasn‚Äôt too spicy, I liked it! I just wish the chicken was a little bigger and more fresh. The churro fries were fun, but nothing too crazy, idk if I‚Äôd order them again.\n\nWe will be coming back. Very fun restaurant, kind of reminds me of Torchy‚Äôs tacos.",

I‚Äôve always grabbed a fork with my tacos to scoop out the good stuff that falls out of there overstuffed tacos. This time, no fork was necessary. The tacos were about half as full as usual. Nothing was falling out. The coconut shrimp taco had only two small shrimp. Half my bites had no shrimp on them. It‚Äôs disappointing considering how awesome their portion sizes used to be. I could justify paying 5-6$ per taco. This experience did not justify those prices. See picture for measly coconut shrimp taco. If you know smoked taco you know this is unusual. Or that it at least used to be.",

However I am VERY pleased to report that they are just as good the second time around! This is now our favorite taco place and I recommend it to everyone. The tacos are $5-7 each but have so much meat in them that the price makes sense in my opinion. Plus I can only eat 1.5 tacos before I‚Äôm stuffed. Both of the monthly special tacos (BLT this month and a pineapple one a few months ago) were the most delicious, and the burnt end Friday special was also sooo yummy! And the churro fries? AMAZING. In short, we are very pleased with our experience and we love this place! (Only negative note: the first time we came it was super dirty and kind of gross, but this time it was very clean! So it redeemed itself)",

I‚Äôve always grabbed a fork with my tacos to scoop out the good stuff that falls out of there overstuffed tacos. This time, no fork was necessary. The tacos were about half as full as usual. Nothing was falling out. The coconut shrimp taco had only two small shrimp. Half my bites had no shrimp on them. It‚Äôs disappointing considering how awesome their portion sizes used to be. I could justify paying 5-6$ per taco. This experience did not justify those prices. See picture for measly coconut shrimp taco. If you know smoked taco you know this is unusual. Or that it at least used to be.",

However I am VERY pleased to report that they are just as good the second time around! This is now our favorite taco place and I recommend it to everyone. The tacos are $5-7 each but have so much meat in them that the price makes sense in my opinion. Plus I can only eat 1.5 tacos before I‚Äôm stuffed. Both of the monthly special tacos (BLT this month and a pineapple one a few months ago) were the most delicious, and the burnt end Friday special was also sooo yummy! And the churro fries? AMAZING. In short, we are very pleased with our experience and we love this place! (Only negative note: the first time we came it was super dirty and kind of gross, but this time it was very clean! So it redeemed itself)",

This place has great vibes and a fun menu with great tacos!\n\nI ordered the Gringo and the Hot Chick. Both were great. The gringo was loaded with brisket and yummy toppings, I would order it again. The hot chick was a unique flavor combo with the corn tortilla, fried chicken, and the hot honey. It wasn‚Äôt too spicy, I liked it! I just wish the chicken was a little bigger and more fresh.
