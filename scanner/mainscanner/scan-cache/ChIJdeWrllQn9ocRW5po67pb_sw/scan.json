The workers couldn‚Äôt care less about this inconvenience and didn‚Äôt offer any type of discount, coupon for next time or nothing. This pizza is NOT cheap and yet it feels like after this experience it should be. Their NE location was good but it seems like it shut down.

Our dasher notified us that when he arrived about , 30-40 minutes after we first ordered through the app, that they had not started our order and it would be 10-20 minutes until it was complete. Long after we ordered, we finally received our pizzas. One was barely edible and the other inedible as it was underbaked and was raw in places. We couldn‚Äôt even pick up a slice of pizza without the dough ripping since it was so raw. In order to even be edible, we would have  to cook the pizza in the oven.\n\nWe have been customers for years, but this is our final straw. The quality is so unpredictable and lately we are receiving more bad orders than good.\n\nI will no longer be ordering from Slice Brothers.\nBuyers beware.",

Each slice was either naked or overloaded with cheese and toppings. They had sent an email asking how the delivery experience was. I provided feedback that it was terrible. I tried calling the restaurant but nobody has answered over the last 10 days. I sent an email on 1/21, with no response.\n\nThis pizza is delicious, so they get 1 star for that.

Each slice was either naked or overloaded with cheese and toppings. They had sent an email asking how the delivery experience was. I provided feedback that it was terrible. I tried calling the restaurant but nobody has answered over the last 10 days. I sent an email on 1/21, with no response.\n\nThis pizza is delicious, so they get 1 star for that.
