From there, absolutely excellent food to the charismatic atmosphere, we had an excellent experience.  The service was top notch, the owner goes above and beyond and the several different appetizers were mouth-watering! Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The trendy and fun atmosphere makes me definitely want to come back for another experience, as well as try more options on their menu. The establishment was very clean and very welcoming.  Good Job guys!! If you are in the area , you should check them out!!",

House cocktails are all incredible, a little light and sweet, but well-balanced and delicious - the frozen espresso martini, azalea lemonade, and mint julep are all fantastic must tries if you're into those drinks or cocktails in general. Dog Park app is a great sampler, everything rocks, especially the stromboli! House salad is very nice, and can't go wrong with Quattro Formaggio Pizza special or Cookies and Cream Dessert Pizza.",

Chesapeake location's food was not even close, it was pretty awful...so bad that we will never go there again.  The service was slow but they seemed to be understaffed so no fault of the staff.  Please don't bother with opening a second location if you can't even come close to the original.",

House cocktails are all incredible, a little light and sweet, but well-balanced and delicious - the frozen espresso martini, azalea lemonade, and mint julep are all fantastic must tries if you're into those drinks or cocktails in general. Dog Park app is a great sampler, everything rocks, especially the stromboli! House salad is very nice, and can't go wrong with Quattro Formaggio Pizza special or Cookies and Cream Dessert Pizza.",

I came in when it wasn't busy at, which is how I prefer it, and it was a great experience. I got the doggy pattle ipa again and it is just as good as I remember, and I had their beer bratwurst for lunch, which I thought was absolutely amazing and delicious. The bartender was very accomodating and friendly, props to him. Its a smaller place, but it also has an outside patio, and the vibe here is very nice. I loved it here. Very good experience for my first time here and I'm glad I was able to make it here finally. Highly recommend it here!",

We love the food and the atmosphere so definitely worth going if you like good pizza. Plus, sometimes you get to pet a dog and that always makes a person happy.  =)",

          "text": "I went there for lunch because i was over in the area. I got the dog bones. They were really good, but it did take 4 napkins to soak up the grease. Then I tried the vegan brat. It wasn't terrible, but was very dry, and the bun was a little over toasted. Bartender recommended the tots...spot on, they were probably some of the besr I have ever had, but the portions....so small. I had the stout. It was pretty good.\n\nService - Awesome. Bartender was really nice and helpful. He checked on me several times.\nFood - If the cheesy bread (Dogbones) wasn't so incredibly greasy (there was literally a pool in the center and underneath) I would say it was great, but that really detracted. Sorry I didn't get a pic. The Brat $14 for a small brat and no side??? Casualt pint has the drunken brat with Fries for $11. That was dry and really over priced. Tots were the saving grace today.\n\nIf you are coming for pizza and beer, you should do ok. But, i definitely would not recommend any sandwiches or brats that don't come with a side. Just way to overpriced. Apps....roll the dice.  once I sopped up the grease, they were good. I had a pretzel at the other location, it was good....guessing it's the same food here. I had 2 beers the dog bones and a brat with tots and it was $50. $50 for lunch. That was before the tip.",
