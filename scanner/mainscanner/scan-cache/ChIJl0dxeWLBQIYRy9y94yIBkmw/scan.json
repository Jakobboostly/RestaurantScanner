From the door is a friendly and young Hostess making us feel like home !\nThe pizza looked amazing fresh mozzarella and that crazy good crust made every bite worth it. The tiramisu was to die for, literally melting in my mouth lets not talk about the Oreo Cheesecake!!!\n\nWe also tried the mozzarella sticks (huge and delicious), and my daughter ordered a seafood pasta that she absolutely loved.\n\nService was excellent fast, friendly, and attentive. The manager and team made sure we were happy from start to finish. The place was spotless seriously, I watched a lady cleaning and polishing the oven for 30 minutes!\n\nHighly recommend this spot for anyone looking for quality food, great service, and a clean, welcoming environment. Perfect place to eat near the Galleria!",

          "text": "‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1 out of 5 stars for pizza, but higher for wings & service)\n\nLet me start by saying, this was one of the most disappointing pizza slices I‚Äôve ever eaten. Here‚Äôs why: the restaurant sells you an old cheese slice‚Äîlikely made earlier that day (or even the day before)‚Äîand then charges extra to add fresh toppings. Afterward, they reheat the slice in the oven, which burns the crust and dries out the old cheese. The result? A slice with the texture of cardboard, no flavor from the sauce or toppings, and an overall stale, reheated taste. Honestly, it reminded me of taking leftover pizza from the fridge and microwaving it‚Äîjust not fresh.\n\nThat being said, not everything was bad. The wings were surprisingly delicious, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The atmosphere was also enjoyable, and the staff were extremely friendly and hardworking, which I truly appreciated.\n\nOverall, if you‚Äôre coming here, I‚Äôd recommend skipping the pizza and sticking with the wings. Great people, nice vibes‚Äîbut the pizza recipe and reheating method really need to change.\n\nAs you can see, Russo‚Äôs commented under my review. Instead of acknowledging the positive things I mentioned about their service and other food I‚Äôve tried, their response only focused on the pizza. In fact, they confirmed in their own words that the slices are made from day-old pizza.\n\nI want to be clear ‚Äî I love pizza, and I‚Äôm sure their large, made-to-order pies are delicious. But the pizza-by-the-slice I had here was still extremely disappointing. There are plenty of places that serve slices fresh, without reheating old cheese and crust. For example, Frank‚Äôs Pizza in downtown, or even another Russo‚Äôs location I‚Äôve visited (I-10 & Silver at the Marq-E), where the slices are always fresh.\n\nThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs frustrating that the same chain can serve pizza by the slice in completely different ways depending on location. My point isn‚Äôt to tear them down, but to be honest for other customers: if you come here, I‚Äôd recommend skipping the giant slice. There are better options elsewhere ‚Äî including at other Russo‚Äôs locations.",

Here‚Äôs why: the restaurant sells you an old cheese slice‚Äîlikely made earlier that day (or even the day before)‚Äîand then charges extra to add fresh toppings. Afterward, they reheat the slice in the oven, which burns the crust and dries out the old cheese. The result? A slice with the texture of cardboard, no flavor from the sauce or toppings, and an overall stale, reheated taste. Honestly, it reminded me of taking leftover pizza from the fridge and microwaving it‚Äîjust not fresh.\n\nThat being said, not everything was bad. The wings were surprisingly delicious, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The atmosphere was also enjoyable, and the staff were extremely friendly and hardworking, which I truly appreciated.\n\nOverall, if you‚Äôre coming here, I‚Äôd recommend skipping the pizza and sticking with the wings. Great people, nice vibes‚Äîbut the pizza recipe and reheating method really need to change.\n\nAs you can see, Russo‚Äôs commented under my review. Instead of acknowledging the positive things I mentioned about their service and other food I‚Äôve tried, their response only focused on the pizza. In fact, they confirmed in their own words that the slices are made from day-old pizza.\n\nI want to be clear ‚Äî I love pizza, and I‚Äôm sure their large, made-to-order pies are delicious. But the pizza-by-the-slice I had here was still extremely disappointing. There are plenty of places that serve slices fresh, without reheating old cheese and crust. For example, Frank‚Äôs Pizza in downtown, or even another Russo‚Äôs location I‚Äôve visited (I-10 & Silver at the Marq-E), where the slices are always fresh.\n\nThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs frustrating that the same chain can serve pizza by the slice in completely different ways depending on location. My point isn‚Äôt to tear them down, but to be honest for other customers: if you come here, I‚Äôd recommend skipping the giant slice. There are better options elsewhere ‚Äî including at other Russo‚Äôs locations.",

          "text": "I came to this location a week ago and ordered a pizza. Not only did it take an hour or more to come out, but it was bad and missing the extras. I told the manager, and she came up with an excuse about the system. I came back a few days later and still, nobody gave me a solution or my money back until I called today (Friday) and the manager or whoever answered was finally able to fix it. When I went, the lady who claims to be the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù was very disrespectful and gave me my refund with an attitude. At this point, the whole situation just seems crazy to me, ONE week for a refund and I got an attitude from her lol",

From the door is a friendly and young Hostess making us feel like home !\nThe pizza looked amazing fresh mozzarella and that crazy good crust made every bite worth it. The tiramisu was to die for, literally melting in my mouth lets not talk about the Oreo Cheesecake!!!\n\nWe also tried the mozzarella sticks (huge and delicious), and my daughter ordered a seafood pasta that she absolutely loved.\n\nService was excellent fast, friendly, and attentive. The manager and team made sure we were happy from start to finish. The place was spotless seriously, I watched a lady cleaning and polishing the oven for 30 minutes!\n\nHighly recommend this spot for anyone looking for quality food, great service, and a clean, welcoming environment. Perfect place to eat near the Galleria!",

He gave us amazing recommendations for both wine and pasta that completely exceeded our expectations ‚Äî every dish was spot on!\n\nWhat really stood out was the level of attention and care he provided. Kito took his time with us, never rushing, always making sure our glasses were full and that we had everything we needed throughout the evening. His friendly and professional demeanor made the entire dining experience feel personal and special.\n\nWithout a doubt, Kito is one of the best waiters I‚Äôve had in the last 10 years staying in Houston ‚Äî and that‚Äôs saying a lot! If you‚Äôre dining at Russo‚Äôs while in Houston, do yourself a favor and ask for Kito. He‚Äôs a true gem!",

Here‚Äôs why: the restaurant sells you an old cheese slice‚Äîlikely made earlier that day (or even the day before)‚Äîand then charges extra to add fresh toppings. Afterward, they reheat the slice in the oven, which burns the crust and dries out the old cheese. The result? A slice with the texture of cardboard, no flavor from the sauce or toppings, and an overall stale, reheated taste. Honestly, it reminded me of taking leftover pizza from the fridge and microwaving it‚Äîjust not fresh.\n\nThat being said, not everything was bad. The wings were surprisingly delicious, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The atmosphere was also enjoyable, and the staff were extremely friendly and hardworking, which I truly appreciated.\n\nOverall, if you‚Äôre coming here, I‚Äôd recommend skipping the pizza and sticking with the wings. Great people, nice vibes‚Äîbut the pizza recipe and reheating method really need to change.\n\nAs you can see, Russo‚Äôs commented under my review. Instead of acknowledging the positive things I mentioned about their service and other food I‚Äôve tried, their response only focused on the pizza. In fact, they confirmed in their own words that the slices are made from day-old pizza.\n\nI want to be clear ‚Äî I love pizza, and I‚Äôm sure their large, made-to-order pies are delicious. But the pizza-by-the-slice I had here was still extremely disappointing. There are plenty of places that serve slices fresh, without reheating old cheese and crust. For example, Frank‚Äôs Pizza in downtown, or even another Russo‚Äôs location I‚Äôve visited (I-10 & Silver at the Marq-E), where the slices are always fresh.\n\nThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs frustrating that the same chain can serve pizza by the slice in completely different ways depending on location. My point isn‚Äôt to tear them down, but to be honest for other customers: if you come here, I‚Äôd recommend skipping the giant slice. There are better options elsewhere ‚Äî including at other Russo‚Äôs locations.",

I told the manager, and she came up with an excuse about the system. I came back a few days later and still, nobody gave me a solution or my money back until I called today (Friday) and the manager or whoever answered was finally able to fix it. When I went, the lady who claims to be the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù was very disrespectful and gave me my refund with an attitude. At this point, the whole situation just seems crazy to me, ONE week for a refund and I got an attitude from her lol",
