My brother and I came about 20 min before our reservation and they still sat us no problem, coffee was phenomenal and our  glasses were never empty. The avocado toast starter was AMAZING. Kinda spicy, with creamy avocado and fresh cr√®me. The toast was very crispy so it had a nice crunch. For our entrees I ordered the funeral potatoe Benedict. It was DENSE, glad I came super hungry. Needed some more salt but the sauce was creamy and delicious, poached egg was perfect. My brother ordered the fried chicken Bahn Mi, and it was massive. He demolished the whole thing, he said it was perfect, I tried a piece and the jalape√±os were the perfect addition to the sandwich.\n\nOverall, a great restaurant with that heavy breakfast food you need after a night out, but with a higher quality and classier feel. Thanks Communal, will be back soon.",

We got a couple of starters, fried cheese (excellent) and carrot hummus. Communal recommends sharing everything so we ordered pork chops, salmon, and a couple of surf and turf plates (the best). For side dishes we decided to share sugar snap peas (so good), squash, and funeral potatoes. At the end we shared a strawberry raspberry crisp for dessert. We should have ordered two as that was the crown jewel of the night. Service was excellent in that we always had our server available to us but knowing not to invade too much.

The CHARM of the place still shines through.\nWish, however, that the FOOD was equally as charming.  I looked forward to having Brunch and upon the servers suggestion, tried their shrimp and grits, adding an over easy egg in addition, again at the servers strong recommendation.  Thank goodness I did because that egg was literally the only saving grace for this dish.   The grits were formed into these triangular, hash brown-like pieces and while I understand the thought behind it, they barely resembled grits.   It just seemed like one big crunchy mass with no real flavor.  And then it was topped with an odd sauce consisting of tomato sauce, a vinegar like aioli and something very bitter and burnt.  The shrimp was delicious but lumped in between all of this chaos, it was a confusing dish to eat.  I was grateful for the silkiness of the egg - it was the only recognizable item on the plate and I needed it to push through the meal.\nThe restaurant has a very upscale and understated classiness about it, which is very appealing.  It LOOKS like a place where you would expect a really special experience.   I, however, left feeling very disappointed.   I do not foresee a return in the future.",

          "text": "I had big expectations for this restaurant and was left a little disappointed. Now I have to say every item including our wine was 5 stars but when it came to the steaks it was disappointing. Now they were cooked to the exact temperature but unfortunately they were cooked on a dirty grill which gave them a burnt taste. Next time I will ask for them to properly scrap the grill in between cookings and maybe oil the grill. I only say these thing as I am 20 + veteran of the fine dining restaurant business and a classically trained chef. So will I go back? Yes but I may not order the steak and for sure will not order the $150 Tomahawk if I dont speak with the chef first. I hope this criticism will be taken positively.",

They informed us that there was another party booked. The restaurant suggested we look over the menu and order asap when we arrived. The waiter was not very friendly. More of a passive aggressive attitude. He brought over a dessert menu letting us know we had about 20/25 mins left at our table. There was another party coming in. We looked around  the dining room and noticed other tables leaving and 2 more empty 4 top tables. We are not sure why they were rushing us when it was obvious that there were open tables for the guests arriving. I feel the hostess and in house staff could‚Äôve been less pushy and could‚Äôve avoided rushing us. After we left we walked around the area and came back to our cars parked in front of the restaurant and guess what??? There were several empty tables that no one was sitting or had reservations. I feel the restaurant did a poor job on customer service. The food was fantastic. Restaurant staff I would rethink how you approach these situations. Never rush the customer if you have ways to juggle your tables.",

The menu changed between our two visits, but on our second visit we had a whipped feta and honey starter topped with walnuts and roasted grapes that came with a bread, which was the highlight of the entire meal. After that, we had garlic mashed potatoes and teriyaki eggplant, which were both unbearably salty to the point that we ate less than half. Finally, we shared the steak frites, which, while cooked medium rare internally, was almost burnt on the outside and was also overly salty. We had a similar experience on our first visit, except we ordered lamb as our main, and while my wife's lamb was cooked correctly, mine was so well done that I was physically unable to cut it with my knife. On top of that, our waiter never checked on us after delivering the lamb, so I never had the chance to ask for a new one. Considering the price tag of these meals, they should be able to know how much salt to put on food and their should definitely know how to cook their meat. Overall, the dining experience here is inconsistent and not worth the price.",

The food was amazing, we got mashed potatoes and blackened carrots, and ribeye steak that was cooked perfectly and shared our meal and had plenty to take home. Service was very friendly and helpful. Christian Singer did a great job and we met the owner and his family who were super friendly and bought us desserts.\n\nThank you for a wonderful evening. I would highly recommend and my wife and I will be going back.",

My brother and I came about 20 min before our reservation and they still sat us no problem, coffee was phenomenal and our  glasses were never empty. The avocado toast starter was AMAZING. Kinda spicy, with creamy avocado and fresh cr√®me. The toast was very crispy so it had a nice crunch. For our entrees I ordered the funeral potatoe Benedict. It was DENSE, glad I came super hungry. Needed some more salt but the sauce was creamy and delicious, poached egg was perfect. My brother ordered the fried chicken Bahn Mi, and it was massive. He demolished the whole thing, he said it was perfect, I tried a piece and the jalape√±os were the perfect addition to the sandwich.\n\nOverall, a great restaurant with that heavy breakfast food you need after a night out, but with a higher quality and classier feel. Thanks Communal, will be back soon.",

The food hits that sweet spot between creative and comforting, and everything feels fresh, seasonal, and made with intention.\n\nThe pork chop and tenderloin is one of my favorites, and the surf & turf frites is worth the splurge. Sides like the carrot hummus and saffron pilaf are legit, and the butterscotch pudding is a must-order.\n\nIt‚Äôs the kind of spot you bring friends to when you want to show off how good the food scene here can be.

The steak was good but have really hard parts in it I could not even chew through and I got maybe like 10 fries I paid 60 pretty much just for the steak.Love the sauce on it though. The waitress who helped me with super kind and understanding let me ask questions and let me try the sauce for the steak loved her. Atmosphere seem more like a relaxing atmosphere someone or families that wanna just relax in a quieter place little Mom and pop filling shop. But I will say I‚Äôm pretty upset that we didn‚Äôt get very many fries and spent a lot of money on it. The picture is half of the fries that we got the other half my boyfriend took, but he got about the same amount or a couple less:(",

The chef was awesome chatting with us while he and his team worked their magic.  One of the best meals we have had on our trip.  Lastly our server Christian was lovely and provided us great info.

          "text": "They were able to seat us immediately when we arrived a few minutes early to our reservation with our party of six. We got a couple of starters, fried cheese (excellent) and carrot hummus. Communal recommends sharing everything so we ordered pork chops, salmon, and a couple of surf and turf plates (the best). For side dishes we decided to share sugar snap peas (so good), squash, and funeral potatoes. At the end we shared a strawberry raspberry crisp for dessert. We should have ordered two as that was the crown jewel of the night. Service was excellent in that we always had our server available to us but knowing not to invade too much. Looking forward to coming back again.",

The CHARM of the place still shines through.\nWish, however, that the FOOD was equally as charming.  I looked forward to having Brunch and upon the servers suggestion, tried their shrimp and grits, adding an over easy egg in addition, again at the servers strong recommendation.  Thank goodness I did because that egg was literally the only saving grace for this dish.   The grits were formed into these triangular, hash brown-like pieces and while I understand the thought behind it, they barely resembled grits.   It just seemed like one big crunchy mass with no real flavor.  And then it was topped with an odd sauce consisting of tomato sauce, a vinegar like aioli and something very bitter and burnt.  The shrimp was delicious but lumped in between all of this chaos, it was a confusing dish to eat.  I was grateful for the silkiness of the egg - it was the only recognizable item on the plate and I needed it to push through the meal.\nThe restaurant has a very upscale and understated classiness about it, which is very appealing.  It LOOKS like a place where you would expect a really special experience.   I, however, left feeling very disappointed.   I do not foresee a return in the future.",

The chicken and squash were so delicious and my favorites.\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars across the board is that we felt rushed to leave.

Dining here was an absolute delight ‚Äì the food was exceptional, and we couldn‚Äôt have been more impressed. Led by Executive Chef Matt Eckelmann, a culinary talent with Brooklyn roots, the restaurant truly shines with its commitment to farm-to-table dining and top-notch flavors.\n\nWe started with the mushroom toast, a perfect appetizer that set the tone for the entire meal. The mushrooms were tender and earthy, seasoned to perfection, and served atop crispy, toasted bread. Next, we savored the house-made potato and cheese ravioli in a savory tomato cream sauce. It was an indulgent, creamy masterpiece, with delicate yet hearty ravioli and a rich, velvety sauce that brought everything together beautifully.\n\nFor the main courses, the salmon was a standout ‚Äì flaky, tender, and cooked to perfection, complemented by a delicate sauce that elevated its flavor. The pork schnitzel was just as impressive ‚Äì crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. Both dishes were extraordinary, especially when paired with the sides of brussels sprouts and bruleed sweet potato. The brussels sprouts had that perfect balance of crispy edges and smokiness, while the sweet potato was beautifully caramelized, adding a delightful sweetness to the plate.\n\nOne key thing I‚Äôll note is to bring an appetite, as the portions are generous, and you won‚Äôt want to miss any of these flavorful dishes. From the moment we walked in, we could tell that Chef Matt Eckelmann‚Äôs passion for great food and high-quality ingredients was at the heart of this restaurant. It was truly a memorable dining experience. You won‚Äôt be disappointed ‚Äì in fact, you‚Äôll likely be planning your next visit before you even leave the table.",

There was not one time our glasses had the chance to near empty.\n\nThe hangar steak was tender, juice, charred to perfection, and cooked a perfect medium rare as requested. The demi glace sauce enhancing and complimenting the subtle yet complex flavors of the steak. Topped with some perfectly crispy fried onion rings to complement the delicious protein with the perfect amount of carby deliciousness.\n\nThe broccoli was drizzled perfectly with a savior sauce and feta. Perfectly charred, full of flavor, and fresher than I've had in a long time. The perfect gentle bite enhancing the texture, and ensuring every bite was mouthwateringly satisfying.\n\nThe cabbage was similar to the broccoli in its perfection, coated with some delicious sauce, almonds, etc. The perfect complement to the meal we ordered.\n\nMy wife described the funeral potatoes as the perfect thinly sliced hash brown, enhanced by a mouthwateringly simple yet delectable sauce. A sure favorite for anyone!\n\nThe house pasta was a feta stuffed hand made pasta, with a seafood infusion in the sauce. Savory to the last bite, devoured in less time than it took to decide to order it.\n\nThe roujan potatoes were perfectly seasoned, and creamed. Not a single bite was discarded. A portion not only perfect for sharing however so well balanced and complementing to each menu item we tasted.\n\nThe charcuterie board was a blend of delicious savory meat, fresh kraut, and so much more. The perfect appetizer to start, share, and prepare for the food to follow.\n\nTo finish off the perfect meal order the apple tart with the perfect brown sugar ice cream on top, or the house made butterscotch pudding that will leave any butterscotch or caramel fan drooling for more every time!",

We‚Äôve had several things and some are delicious but others are so so. The hanger steak is pretty good. The poached pear salad is really bitter and I would recommend against it, unless you‚Äôre into that. The funeral potatoes were the best item we ordered last night, and they‚Äôre always good. The Brussels sprouts are really good as well, but fyi they come with an almost raw egg on top. I just avoided it, but my husband likes it like that. The pasta we had last night was pretty bad. It was a three cheese tortellini, but the pasta had the texture like it wasn‚Äôt cooked all the way. Even my husband didn‚Äôt like it, and he‚Äôll eat anything. We told the waitresses (who was so kind and friendly), and she took a piece back to ask the chef if it was supposed to be that way. Of course he said it was intended to be that way, but we didn‚Äôt like it. It honestly just tasted like it needed 4-5 more minutes of cooking time.  They took it off our bill, which was really nice of them. I know that the menu changes regularly, a couple years ago we had the BEST chicken and mashed potatoes there, and it was easily a five, but this time around I can‚Äôt say the current menu is a five. Ps‚Ä¶ I gave the atmosphere 3 stars because even though it‚Äôs the communal the tables to the right I‚Äôd the main door are so incredibly close. You might as well be eating with the person next to you.",

Communal was just across the stress so we went to try it.  It's a lot more expensive than we were planning on.  The food was good and the atmosphere was cozy. I don't feel the food was worth the price though. If I'm paying $30-$40 for a dish,  and it doesn't include a side,  I expect the food to be really good. My favorite part of my meal was the salad.

We were the first people in the restaurant and ordered our food before anyone else. We got our food after everyone else that walked in. Once we finally got our food the steak we ordered was burnt, it tasted like we were eating a grill and had no seasoning. Everything else we ordered was great and our waitress took the steak off of our order she was amazing.",

We didn‚Äôt have reservations, but one of the very friendly managers seated us at the bar top & said it was his favorite place. We loved it! Watching & chatting with the patient master chef as he expertly prepared several amazing dishes was great fun & very educational. Wife had the Tamarin Glazed Chicken but could not stop raving about the Roasted Carrots. Son devoured the delicious Watermelon starter & the formidable Pork Chop Schnitzel. I savored a trout special called Pescado Veracruz with very tasty Fried Garlic Rice. The Halibut also looked great. We were all too full, but the dessert menu looked fabulous. Great atmosphere & interesting art & decor. By no means inexpensive, but worth every penny.",

It was overrated and all tasted the same. On top of the experience, I wore my 40-year-old vintage custom-made suede jacket. I placed the coat on the chair next to me and draped it over the chair in plain site. The waiter was very good, but he came over to check on our food and happened to lean on the chair gripping my coat. His hands were very wet and I mentioned to him he was touching my jacket and his hands were wet. He apologized and said it was water. I responded, \"No, it's not! It's oil.\" It was oil and my jacket was stained and turned green. I contacted the restaurant to inform them and they never returned my calls or messages. This is unacceptable.",

The chicken was underwhelming, as if it was just raw meat with a sprinkle of seasoning‚Äîbrining could have made a world of difference. The pasta was clearly not fresh, and the ‚Äòfuneral‚Äô potatoes were a complete letdown. They need to go find a local grandma who knows how to make them properly, full of flavor and comfort. Without the sauce, they were flavorless and dull. The mashed potatoes were even worse, lacking the creamy texture and taste you‚Äôd expect. For an $80 meal, I expected much more passion, care, and respect for the craft. Where‚Äôs the love for good food? The fact that the restaurant was nearly empty on a Wednesday night speaks volumes about the current state of this place. Sadly, it seems to have lost its former charm. The worst part? Forcing ourselves to finish it, just to avoid wasting food and to get our calories in. Where‚Äôs the passion? Where‚Äôs the respect?",

This time I ordered the house pasta, which for $30 was a very tiny portion, but it was pretty good. And I ordered the basque cheesecake, which was severely burned over the entire top. I know that basque cheesecake is supposed to be toasted on top. But this was black and burned about 1/4 inch down (see photos to compare to an actual basque cheesecake). Even when I scraped off the burned layer, the rest of the cake was so over baked it was rubbery and not enjoyable. I didn‚Äôt eat it. I called to ask for a refund and they repeatedly told me that‚Äôs exactly how it was supposed to be but that they would give me the refund. The tone was annoyed and condescending, not at all willing to admit that they‚Äôd burned the cake and talking to me like I‚Äôm just too ignorant to know if what I‚Äôm eating is good or not. I am sure basque cheesecake is delicious when done correctly. This was not. My experience has been similar about 50% of the time I‚Äôve eaten here. The kinds of mistakes you just shouldn‚Äôt have to put up with when you‚Äôre paying this much (over baked, under cooked, arriving cold at the table, too salty, etc.). The menu is ambitious but the execution is just so often not there. I guess I keep trying because there are not that many menus like this in Utah County. But I‚Äôm tired of paying this much and not getting a fine dining experience.",

Now I have to say every item including our wine was 5 stars but when it came to the steaks it was disappointing. Now they were cooked to the exact temperature but unfortunately they were cooked on a dirty grill which gave them a burnt taste. Next time I will ask for them to properly scrap the grill in between cookings and maybe oil the grill. I only say these thing as I am 20 + veteran of the fine dining restaurant business and a classically trained chef. So will I go back? Yes but I may not order the steak and for sure will not order the $150 Tomahawk if I dont speak with the chef first. I hope this criticism will be taken positively.",

They informed us that there was another party booked. The restaurant suggested we look over the menu and order asap when we arrived. The waiter was not very friendly. More of a passive aggressive attitude. He brought over a dessert menu letting us know we had about 20/25 mins left at our table. There was another party coming in. We looked around  the dining room and noticed other tables leaving and 2 more empty 4 top tables. We are not sure why they were rushing us when it was obvious that there were open tables for the guests arriving. I feel the hostess and in house staff could‚Äôve been less pushy and could‚Äôve avoided rushing us. After we left we walked around the area and came back to our cars parked in front of the restaurant and guess what??? There were several empty tables that no one was sitting or had reservations. I feel the restaurant did a poor job on customer service. The food was fantastic. Restaurant staff I would rethink how you approach these situations. Never rush the customer if you have ways to juggle your tables.",

The menu changed between our two visits, but on our second visit we had a whipped feta and honey starter topped with walnuts and roasted grapes that came with a bread, which was the highlight of the entire meal. After that, we had garlic mashed potatoes and teriyaki eggplant, which were both unbearably salty to the point that we ate less than half. Finally, we shared the steak frites, which, while cooked medium rare internally, was almost burnt on the outside and was also overly salty. We had a similar experience on our first visit, except we ordered lamb as our main, and while my wife's lamb was cooked correctly, mine was so well done that I was physically unable to cut it with my knife. On top of that, our waiter never checked on us after delivering the lamb, so I never had the chance to ask for a new one. Considering the price tag of these meals, they should be able to know how much salt to put on food and their should definitely know how to cook their meat. Overall, the dining experience here is inconsistent and not worth the price.",

The CHARM of the place still shines through.\nWish, however, that the FOOD was equally as charming.  I looked forward to having Brunch and upon the servers suggestion, tried their shrimp and grits, adding an over easy egg in addition, again at the servers strong recommendation.  Thank goodness I did because that egg was literally the only saving grace for this dish.   The grits were formed into these triangular, hash brown-like pieces and while I understand the thought behind it, they barely resembled grits.   It just seemed like one big crunchy mass with no real flavor.  And then it was topped with an odd sauce consisting of tomato sauce, a vinegar like aioli and something very bitter and burnt.  The shrimp was delicious but lumped in between all of this chaos, it was a confusing dish to eat.  I was grateful for the silkiness of the egg - it was the only recognizable item on the plate and I needed it to push through the meal.\nThe restaurant has a very upscale and understated classiness about it, which is very appealing.  It LOOKS like a place where you would expect a really special experience.   I, however, left feeling very disappointed.   I do not foresee a return in the future.",
