I walked in around 3:30pm on a Thursday, and I was the sole customer. They have a small (~ 6 small parties) seating area and restrooms for those who want to dine in, and whoever was in control of the music was a Swiftie! I will say that both times I have been here the person working the register has not been the most alert, but apologetic once I got their attention.\n\nI got the pulled pork bowl ($15.16), which is an elevated Chipotle bowl. I went for the bowl over the arepas because 1 arepa was almost the same price, and I felt like the bowl would be more filling. If you prefer smaller meals, I think you can get the most bang for your buck with the bowl, since you can split it into 2 meals. I was starving, so I consumed it all in one sitting, and it was filling indeed! I felt like the ingredient selection and quality justified the price, and the plantains were definitely a highlight! The pulled pork was juicy and well flavored, rice was on the softer side, and the tomatoes in the salsa (under avocado in picture) were delicious. My only critique of this bowl is that the layout is pretty but not practical for mixing.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go out of my way for White Maize but I will be a regular when I have business in the area!",

          "text": "White Maize has been on my list for a long time, so once I had a reason to be in Carroll Gardens, I decided to finally check it out! I walked in around 3:30pm on a Thursday, and I was the sole customer. They have a small (~ 6 small parties) seating area and restrooms for those who want to dine in, and whoever was in control of the music was a Swiftie! I will say that both times I have been here the person working the register has not been the most alert, but apologetic once I got their attention.\n\nI got the pulled pork bowl ($15.16), which is an elevated Chipotle bowl. I went for the bowl over the arepas because 1 arepa was almost the same price, and I felt like the bowl would be more filling. If you prefer smaller meals, I think you can get the most bang for your buck with the bowl, since you can split it into 2 meals. I was starving, so I consumed it all in one sitting, and it was filling indeed! I felt like the ingredient selection and quality justified the price, and the plantains were definitely a highlight! The pulled pork was juicy and well flavored, rice was on the softer side, and the tomatoes in the salsa (under avocado in picture) were delicious. My only critique of this bowl is that the layout is pretty but not practical for mixing.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go out of my way for White Maize but I will be a regular when I have business in the area!",

I walked in around 3:30pm on a Thursday, and I was the sole customer. They have a small (~ 6 small parties) seating area and restrooms for those who want to dine in, and whoever was in control of the music was a Swiftie! I will say that both times I have been here the person working the register has not been the most alert, but apologetic once I got their attention.\n\nI got the pulled pork bowl ($15.16), which is an elevated Chipotle bowl. I went for the bowl over the arepas because 1 arepa was almost the same price, and I felt like the bowl would be more filling. If you prefer smaller meals, I think you can get the most bang for your buck with the bowl, since you can split it into 2 meals. I was starving, so I consumed it all in one sitting, and it was filling indeed! I felt like the ingredient selection and quality justified the price, and the plantains were definitely a highlight! The pulled pork was juicy and well flavored, rice was on the softer side, and the tomatoes in the salsa (under avocado in picture) were delicious. My only critique of this bowl is that the layout is pretty but not practical for mixing.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go out of my way for White Maize but I will be a regular when I have business in the area!",
