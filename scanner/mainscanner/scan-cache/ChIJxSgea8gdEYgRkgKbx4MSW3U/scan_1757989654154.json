Cheese curds for an appetizer turned out to be a good start, everybody enjoyed them.  Lots of good drink choices, with some Michigan beers available.  Ribs were delicious, good smokey flavor and cooked perfect.  Burger and mac and cheese were great. Wish I could have talked my daughter into adding the brisket with the mac and cheese, but she wasn't interested.  No room for dessert.  Would return if in the area again.",

          "text": "We stopped in for an early dinner on a Wednesday. It was very slow and we basically had the place to ourselves. The staff went above and beyond to make our first time amazing. My husband ordered the All-American burger and fries which he enjoyed throughly. I ordered a Ranch Water to drink and the Fish & Chips. Let me tell you, their fries are phenomenal! The fish not so much. BUT, as I said, the staff was extremely friendly and involved to try to fix the issue. The first batch that came out, the batter was quite dark and yet there was no crisp or crunch and was almost raw in spots. The fish inside was still fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly and their tartar sauce was delicious! Our server brought it to the attention of the manager and chef. They made me another batch to try again on the batter. Even though it didn't work the second time, I wasn't upset. They handled the situation amazingly and even brought out a small to-go of their Chocolate Cake to apologize. We still left full, happy, and wanting to go back again in the future. Hopefully the 4 stars can go up to a 5. Thank you again for the great food and hospitality!",

The pizza was loaded with flavor ‚Äî melty cheese, sweet pineapple, savory BBQ, and a kick of freshness from the scallions. The salad was colorful and packed with texture ‚Äî crunchy tortilla strips, roasted corn, buffalo cauliflower, and creamy dressing on the side. Definitely a spot we‚Äôll come back to!",

After waiting just to be noticed, we were seated among dirty tables that hadn‚Äôt been cleared.\n\nOur server, Steve, was abrupt, snooty, and inattentive‚Äîmore interested in attitude than service. The food? Mediocre at best, and certainly not worth overlooking the lack of hospitality.\n\nThis was a disappointing experience all around. We won‚Äôt be back, and we won‚Äôt be recommending Union Pier Social to anyone.",

The menu has several options for different people, and enough options that it was somewhat difficult to pick. The food tasted very good and came out hot. Unfortunately, the service was pretty subpar. In total, we were at the restaurant for a little over two hours. The wait time was understandable because of how many people were there, but we rarely saw our server and had to constantly try to get her attention for refills and the bill. Would likely go back and give it another chance for service because the atmosphere and food are great.",

My husband ordered the All-American burger and fries which he enjoyed throughly. I ordered a Ranch Water to drink and the Fish & Chips. Let me tell you, their fries are phenomenal! The fish not so much. BUT, as I said, the staff was extremely friendly and involved to try to fix the issue. The first batch that came out, the batter was quite dark and yet there was no crisp or crunch and was almost raw in spots. The fish inside was still fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly and their tartar sauce was delicious! Our server brought it to the attention of the manager and chef. They made me another batch to try again on the batter. Even though it didn't work the second time, I wasn't upset. They handled the situation amazingly and even brought out a small to-go of their Chocolate Cake to apologize. We still left full, happy, and wanting to go back again in the future. Hopefully the 4 stars can go up to a 5. Thank you again for the great food and hospitality!",

          "text": "Three of us had lunch here today. The service was great but the food was hit-or-miss. We split the ahi tuna tacos as an appetizer and they were very good (if not light on the amount of tuna in each). My adult son ordered the Italian beef sandwich but didn‚Äôt love it (although the fries were excellent). Now to the Marguerita pizza . . . which was very disappointing. The crust was paper thin and soggy on the bottom but huge and puffy around the edges, and both were extremely bland and flavorless. If you‚Äôre in the mood for pizza, you‚Äôll find better options around town. This was our first visit and we will likely try again at some point - but we‚Äôll steer clear of the pizza.",

To celebrate a family 70th birthday, we called ahead and they reserved for us their side room with a decorative divider from the main space. All of the employees were very nice, and our server, Sam, was pleasant and on top of it! Their menu has a wonderful variety of options for adults and kids.  We were all shocked at how quickly they brought out our orders, and everyone talked about how much they liked the food. The bar and patio looked very nice. We look forward to coming again.

Cheese curds for an appetizer turned out to be a good start, everybody enjoyed them.  Lots of good drink choices, with some Michigan beers available.  Ribs were delicious, good smokey flavor and cooked perfect.  Burger and mac and cheese were great. Wish I could have talked my daughter into adding the brisket with the mac and cheese, but she wasn't interested.  No room for dessert.  Would return if in the area again.",

He was so accommodating. His customer service is impeccable. He listened to our needs. He showed so much kindness, when asked to work with a family member‚Äôs allergies. He is most certainly  an asset to Union Pier Social. I discovered they do different charities and give back to the local community. I love that! I look forward to working with Steven and Union Pier Social. Thank you. This visit we had the summer berry salad and the strawberry bruschetta. Oh, and they make their own bread.",

We visited at 6 pm on a Wednesday and they were out of the brisket and Italian beef sandwiches.  Kind of unacceptable when the menu isn't extensive to begin with and they weren't busy.  The pulled pork sandwich was meh and the Chick-aming sandwich was blah.  Service wasn't good either.  We had to flag down a different server to get flatware, napkins and drink refills after our food arrived as our server was nowhere to be found and he never checked in until we finished.  I guess it helps that there aren't many options in this area . . .  One visit was too many.  Not coming back.",

Demoraron un poco en asignarnos una mesa. Y no veo muy bien que los tenedores, cucharas y cuchillos est√©n en la entrada y los envuelven en la servilleta delante de los clientes y los lleven contigo al momento de asignarte le mesa. Pero de resto todo perfecto. Me encant√≥ el lugar, si volver√≠a. Y los fines de semana hay m√∫sica en vivo.",

We split the ahi tuna tacos as an appetizer and they were very good (if not light on the amount of tuna in each). My adult son ordered the Italian beef sandwich but didn‚Äôt love it (although the fries were excellent). Now to the Marguerita pizza . . . which was very disappointing. The crust was paper thin and soggy on the bottom but huge and puffy around the edges, and both were extremely bland and flavorless. If you‚Äôre in the mood for pizza, you‚Äôll find better options around town. This was our first visit and we will likely try again at some point - but we‚Äôll steer clear of the pizza.",
