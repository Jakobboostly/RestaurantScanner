Most of the meal was predominantly bread: salad ‚Üí whole pizza ‚Üí half pizza ‚Üí pasta ‚Üí whole pizza ‚Üí dessert (two chunks of watermelon). While the food itself was okay, it wasn‚Äôt anything special, and the value just wasn‚Äôt there.\n\nThe wine pairing was disappointing, and we later realized we could have ordered everything individually from the menu for less than the set price. Service also felt awkward ‚Äî instead of thoughtful stories or inspiration for each dish (as advertised), we were just given a quick list of ingredients, with little enthusiasm. It didn‚Äôt feel like the intimate, passionate omakase-style experience it was trying to be.\n\nThey make decent pizza, but trying to deliver a tasting menu/omakase experience just isn‚Äôt their strength ‚Äî they‚Äôd be better off focusing on what they do well. To top it off, a 20% gratuity was automatically added and then we were prompted to tip on top of that. Overall, not worth the cost or the hype.",

My husbands friend recommended, they had pizzacase, (a take on Japanese omakase) and a 4 course menu for $50 per person, wasn‚Äôt all pizzas they said. )\nAny tasting menu I have had (which is many) you each get an individual serving. So first course comes, it‚Äôs nice size bowl of tomatoes , they then came with 3 plates , suddenly didn‚Äôt look like such a big bowl for 3. We thought maybe an extra course or amuse bush. Then they bring a very small bowl of mussels , thought 2 more were coming , but no. I counted , there were 7 mussels for 3 people. And we just got back from Europe where a serving was prob 30 or so mussels for one person. We still thought maybe that was an extra little bite. Now we‚Äôre starting to wonder did that count as 2 courses ? We said no , or assumed there were going to be at least 2 pizzas and a big main dish.\nThey bring out a individual plate with barely a half chicken on it , but at least we were each getting a plate of chicken. So we thought , that was for the 3 of us. I even asked how do we share this ? It was served as one piece of chicken on the bone. And big surprise, only one pizza .\nI‚Äôm on zepbound , my husband barely eats my son eats a lot . We were all starving , the tiny pizza was the biggest thing they gave us . So they changed $150 plus tax and tip for 1 bowl of tomatoes, 7 mussels , 1 pizza and a piece of chicken. Which were all on the menu. So $150 for  $100 worth of food barely . We then ordered a pasta which was actually terrible, they were going for al dente , but if you cut noodle they were not cooked at all. The noodles are raw . And we were expecting some kind of truffle/parma something pizza. It was pepperoni pizza. Maybe if we just shared a pizza and a salad we would of thought it was fine . At almost $300 we left hungry and mad . It just wasn‚Äôt right .",

So they changed $150 plus tax and tip for 1 bowl of tomatoes, 7 mussels , 1 pizza and a piece of chicken. Which were all on the menu. So $150 for  $100 worth of food barely . We then ordered a pasta which was actually terrible, they were going for al dente , but if you cut noodle they were not cooked at all. The noodles are raw . And we were expecting some kind of truffle/parma something pizza. It was pepperoni pizza. Maybe if we just shared a pizza and a salad we would of thought it was fine . At almost $300 we left hungry and mad . It just wasn‚Äôt right .",

          "text": "We ordered just ala carte pizza and caesar. I ordered the sausage and red sauce and my wife ordered the white pizza with veggies. We had heard a lot about MPN and were excited to check out the pizza. When we ordered we asked the waiter to to ask the chef to bake our pizzas with a crispy crust. Afterall, who likes pizza that flops out of your hand when you pick it up. The waiter gave us a puzzled look and said that their pizzas were prepared by the chef to his standards. (Eg we don‚Äôt listen to our customers, the chef knows best.). When the pizza arrived it was more like wet cardboard with sauce and toppings. We asked the waiter if the chef was going to be pissed if we sent the pizzas back for more time in the oven. He hesitated and said yes, he would be. It immediately reminded us of the soup naxi on old reruns of SNL. A indignant chef with an ego and a take it or leave it attitude. I get, in highly rated restaurants, never ask for salt or modifications because the chef knows best. But geez this is a pizza restaurant selling $24 pizzas! On a positive note, the sauce and toppings were really good, but the crust was soggy, limp and too chewy. I didn‚Äôt even finish the pizza and left it‚Äôs cold limp dead crust on my plate. Way over rated.",

Everything was exceptional, including the detailed description of what we were eating and how it was prepared. This was not just pizza. It started with a beautiful tomato salad, followed by several kinds of pizza, and also pasta, risotto balls, a ‚Äúpizza sandwich‚Äù, and a delightful peach/cherry/ricotta concoction for dessert.

The peaches , tomatoes and mussels were so fresh.\nThe pizza was too doughy imo and didn‚Äôt have enough sauce where I felt the dough over powered the course, which I was a little bummed because it did sound like a great pizza.

The website was hard to navigate for my friend‚Äôs grandfather and after putting down +$200 for our reservation we got there and realized we had reserved a tasting menu. We asked if we could switch the reservation to ordering off of the menu instead and the hostess said absolutely and immediately accommodated the request. She did not say anything about food being already prepared or that it would be an inconvenience in any way. If we had known, we would have stuck with what we paid for. Payton, the owner, came up to us and yelled at us. He called us rude for not understanding what we reserved and proceeded to berate my friend‚Äôs grandfather. We considered leaving despite having already ordered, but as a veteran he said he had never walked out on anything and he didn‚Äôt plan to start tonight.

My wife and I were able to visit for a date night out and finally caught it on a day they're open (they're closed Monday and Tuesday when we always seem to want to go in the past).\n\nFood:\nSo we had a salad, 2 pizzas, and a dessert wanting to simply try all the things.  The salad was a burrata cheese salad that had a lemon oil dressing, the cheese and dressing were great...it looked simple but wonderfully light.  The pizzas, I did a white pizza with mushroom and my wife had the zucchini base pizza.  The pizzas were some of the best I've ever had.  The dough was very light tasting and the crust isn't one you should pass eating on, the ingredients all fresh and well prepared.  The dessert was a zippoli.....it was like a having a state fair fried doughnut but with a great caramel sauce.....just try it all.\n\nService:\nSo we ended up eating at the bar and our server was on point with recommendations and the check ins.  I forget his name now, but very nice and pleasant.\n\nAtmosphere:\nSo there is a paid parking lot next to the restaurant and they'll validate your parking.  But the star off is for the size if the restaurant.....its tiny so seating is hard to get.\n\nEverything said this is a must try place, just know if you have a large group this isn't the place for you.  Anything more than 4 people and I doubt you get seating and likely wouldn't enjoy your experience.",

Sharing stories of pizza and how Mission Pizza came to be. We had a multitude of courses including imported cheeses, Apulian tomatoes, Octopus, and local produce. All so well paired. Chef smith is a humble man with a true, honest passion for food. The service was incredible, the Negronis well made, and the wine selection is killer. Definitely would recommend the 2023 Sangiovese Ros√© that chef made in collaboration with Botanist and Barrel. Look for Maradonas face above the bar and that‚Äôs the wine! There‚Äôs no shortage of Neapolitan fare!  From one chef to another, Cheers! We hope to be back very soon.",

          "text": "When you first walk in, it‚Äôs not horrible. It looks kinda nice however for the expensive five star restaurant of pizza with really nothing else that‚Äôs bland because that‚Äôs how Italian people like their food especially Pizza. I would give this a zero Naples Italy, where I‚Äôve had pizza taste better than this place.  And it looks like from all the reviews the owner likes to take his time refusing bad reviews more than making his restaurant look better. You go in there and it‚Äôs dark as hell if you died in there, no one would know you were dead  The waitress is the hostess, and she refused to even see anybody in an empty restaurant with only five people  Then continues to explain it will cost about $60 a person for a 4 to 5 course meal. It‚Äôs called Mission Pizza  Again, pizza restaurant. They have five beers on the menu. This is not a place to go eat pizza unless you are looking for a very weird time in a low lit red light area. Also, don‚Äôt try to go to the bathroom my buddy told me you will probably piss on yourself because it‚Äôs So dark in there and the lights don‚Äôt work properly. Before the restaurant being so expensive at it is for a personal size pizza being $24 with pretty much just cheese you can buy from the supermarket on the thin crust that you could buy, Yes, it is Neapolitan style so if you‚Äôre going there, don‚Äôt expect good tasting pizza. If you‚Äôve never had Italian pizza, you‚Äôre in for a treat. Very overpriced, Atmosphere is literally almost eating in the dark, Lacks enthusiasm or even any color besides red, at 5pm. It looks like a bar with an open kitchen.  Burke St., Pizza but with red lights. And extra seating that‚Äôs pretty much what it was. However, Burke St., Pizza taste so much better. Make sure that you go online and read their website. I have no idea how this business has stayed open since 2014. I think the owner is writing on the coattails of his awards of winning whatever he won being a chef. I also think that he bought into all these good reviews that you see on here cause there is no way that this restaurant has gotten so many good reviews for a Winston-Salem area. And if you read the good reviews, it says that a lot of college kids go there college kids can‚Äôt afford this place. Do better.",

          "text": "Became aware of this restaurant while watching an episode of NC Weekend on UNC TV that showcased it. We rarely (see also never) venture to ‚ÄúThe Dash‚Äù so we planned a one-day road trip to visit. The first indication that we were in for a wonderful dining experience was when I made an on-line reservation and was required to place a $60 deposit (applied to the bill at the end so don‚Äôt panic frugal friends). MPK is in the W-S downtown district where we found lots of shops and galleries to wander through-a nice surprise. MPK is very unassuming from the outside. The interior decor was sparse (by design I think) and I would describe it as a great example of modern industrial minimalism. The space was very clean and squared-away. Concrete and wood prevail in a dimly lit galley style dining space with tables along one wall and a high bar on the other that bellies up to the kitchen. This puts the focus on the wide open kitchen space where the chefs use a wood fired oven to spin their magic. The menu was limited to a few (maybe 12-15 dishes) but in my dining experience this usually translates to a truly delicious dining experience as only the freshest ingredients are being used to create the tastiest meals. Side note: restaurants with tri-fold menus should always be avoided as they very rarely (never) provide a memorable dining experience (unless you count indigestion as memorable). These days, going out to eat is a luxury and we as patrons should expect a memorable dining experience and we got exactly that at MPK. We opted to give the chef an unbridled creative license to cook for us by opting for their Prix Fixe option-5 rounds of whatever the chef wanted to make for us. We made the correct choice for the chef embarked on a quest to bombard and lambaste our taste buds. Like a well-experienced prize fighter Chef came out swinging with a selection of delicious and savory creations. Round one: Chef softened us up with a tangy and savory vinaigrette dressed greens with fresh crabmeat that dazzled. Round two: An unexpectedly delicious mushroom farro with layered flavors and perfect texture had us on the ropes. Round three: Chef had us figured out by now and he was clearly setting us up for the knockout as he hit us with a plate of steamed clams and PEI mussels in a rich, slightly spicy garlic red sauce-our knees became weak. Round four: The knock out blow came in the form of a wood fired pepperoni pizza with their ‚Äúroni butter‚Äù crust that had us staggering and we were down for the count. As we waived our white napkin in surrender our server cam to the rescue and presented us with a plate of braised, slightly candied pears on a bed of lemon panna cotta topped with toasted pine nuts. This dessert was truly a delicious way cap off the evening and revived us enough to get us back to the dressing room!\nOverall our evening at MPK was exceptional. We wish more restaurants would put forth this kind of effort to elevate their product and provide patrons with food that hits both belly and soul. Hey Chef, we want a rematch!!!",

When my husband who has a foot injury tried to sit in an unused stool, he was told he was not allowed to sit.  It was clear during our 1 hour wait that the maitre de' was stressed but I didn't think he would take it out on us.  When I explained that my husband had a foot issue and couldn't stand for long periods of time, the guy at the front told us there were no exceptions and he was upset my husband had used the chair without asking.  Too bad, like I said, the food is decent.  We won't be back after being treated so rudely.  Also, to be clear, wait staff was competent and not the issue.",

          "text": "Our group of 4 adults went for the Prix Fixe dinner.  First off, service was great but I did not like an included 20% gratuity.  For only a party of 4 please let me decide how much gratuity to give based on the service I receive.  Secondly - on a bill that is nearly $100 per person, please give me a clean plate for each course and an extra napkin on the table to set my dirty silverware between courses.  Some of the courses had sauces and dressings and my next course was sitting on top of all of those flavors left over on my plate.  We only received one plate change and a separate dish for dessert, but my dessert spoon was laid directly on the table with no napkin underneath.  First course was a salad, second was stuffed mussels, third was seared tuna, fourth was one personal sized pizza to share between the four of us, and then a dessert for each of us.  It was not an appropriate amount of food when you compared similar dishes from the menu to what we paid per person.  We should have just stopped in for a pizza and not done the prix fixe - there was no value to the ‚Äòexperience‚Äô.  I enjoyed the surprise of what was served and the food was pretty good, but was I blown away or would I return, no.",

Regrettably the dough wasn‚Äôt fermented long enough as evidenced by the lack of color on the bottom and the pizza was cooked too quickly in the hottest part of the oven.  The result was an undercooked middle  with speckles of char around the crust.  A big letdown for the lofty price",

I‚Äôm not going to lie, we are a bit spoiled. My husband also enjoys being my companion on these food trips. He (is quite the chef) so he also offers his opinion on the dishes &  the service. It‚Äôs an adventure!\n\nWe were at the NC Zoo, yesterday & googled places to eat near Winston Salem & Mission came up. After reading a bit about being James Beard Semi-Finalists, it Intrigued us, so we drove around an hour to get here.\n\nWe ordered a pizza, two Pellegrinos, my husband got a beer, we also went with a Lobster fennel pasta & the broccolini.\n\nHere‚Äôs the family consensus, you may disagree but we all agreed on the following:\nFor the money, the pizza should be bigger. It was good, yes, but $25 for a Soppresata pizza that barely feeds two‚Ä¶..Truthfully, that‚Äôs too much. Please note: All 3 of us agreed on that.\n\nThe lobster pasta with fennel was very tasty üëåIn fact, hands down, my favorite of the visit. And last, the Broccolini was okay.\n\nIf we happen to be in the area again, I might want to try more off the menu. Check them out for yourself &\nBuon Appetito üç¥\n\nJosephine Local Guide",

MPN is better for wine than beer but the beer is mostly local and good too. The pizzakase was exceptional. Attentive staff, interacting with the chefs, a great atmosphere at a counter - like omakase in a sushi place. We were served two exceptional salads, the second centered around crab and peach, interleaved with pieces of neopolitan pizza. The first was a cacio e pepe pizza that was outstanding, and it just got better. Dessert was a generous and delicious chocolate panna cotta. I went in kind of skeptical, and left thinking it was worth every penny. Will be back to try the price fixed and repeat the pizzakase.",

Highly recommend the pizzakase reservation because you get to try so many different things and we had four different pizzas (including a deep fried pizza dough pizza) along with multiple other dishes and everything is excellent. The rosemary dessert phenomenal as well. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough, the best.",

By the time we were seated, we were really hungry. They were out of two apps that we wanted so we settled for a salad and pizza. The arugula salad was so dry. I normally go very light on my dressing but this was like eating grass. We also got the burrata pizza and it was very bland.",

Prixe fixe on Thursday last included a deep arugula salad with fennel and prosciutto, a mussel dish that had me slurping up the extra broth, and a juicy version of linguine alle vongole (fresh clams, perfectly cooked) with some kind of irresistible crunchy magic that had me LICKING the outside of the damn shells. There was a basil ‚Äònduja pizza that slapped, and an unusual dessert for NC‚Äî a lux combo of burrata, herbs, and blistered peaches. It was gorgeous. Wine pairings were spot on. Wait staff, spot on. As always, we look forward to eating here again. Hard to believe this restaurant exists outside Berkeley or Brooklyn.

I could not believe that I was eating something so incredible in WS - there was actual guanciale, the pasta was cooked al dente, the flavor, the temperature, the portion size, everything was perfect. Of course the pizza is fantastic, I could eat it every day, but don‚Äôt stop there ! Try the prix fixe, the pizzakase, the specials. Every ingredient is sourced thoughtfully, locally if possible, and served fresh. ‚ÄãD‚Äãon't forget to check out the Baller wine section, you‚Äôll find things there you won‚Äôt anywhere else‚Äã and sometimes they're 20% off.

            "text": "We were recommended this restaurant as a great place to get pizza, and wow! It was very yawn worthy. 26 dollars for a pizza that is not 12\", not 16\", but some random size that you can't eat by yourself nor share with anyone. If you are the type that enjoys paying triple the price you should pay, you will love the menu that is forced down your throat.. No substitutions, come on. Fennel is gross but you still make me eat it! Un b leevable",

            "text": "We tried the pizzakase menu (6 shared courses + wine pairing) and unfortunately left feeling very underwhelmed for the price ‚Äî our bill was $334 for two.\n\nThe concept is a play on Japanese omakase, which we were excited about, but the execution fell short. Most of the meal was predominantly bread: salad ‚Üí whole pizza ‚Üí half pizza ‚Üí pasta ‚Üí whole pizza ‚Üí dessert (two chunks of watermelon). While the food itself was okay, it wasn‚Äôt anything special, and the value just wasn‚Äôt there.\n\nThe wine pairing was disappointing, and we later realized we could have ordered everything individually from the menu for less than the set price. Service also felt awkward ‚Äî instead of thoughtful stories or inspiration for each dish (as advertised), we were just given a quick list of ingredients, with little enthusiasm. It didn‚Äôt feel like the intimate, passionate omakase-style experience it was trying to be.\n\nThey make decent pizza, but trying to deliver a tasting menu/omakase experience just isn‚Äôt their strength ‚Äî they‚Äôd be better off focusing on what they do well. To top it off, a 20% gratuity was automatically added and then we were prompted to tip on top of that. Overall, not worth the cost or the hype.",
