I would still visit Eimi again, but unfortunately I‚Äôm more likely to choose other local ramen/Japanese places from now on\n\nWe love this place! I have noticed some minor inconsistencies in the food quality at times, but I love their tonkotsu ramen and appetizers so much that it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me. They utilize a mobile ordering system, which may seem confusing on a first visit, but quickly becomes comfortable and efficient. You scan a QR code at the table to view the menu AND place your order. The staff are kind though and definitely willing to help out if you have questions or special requests/concerns. The dining area and decorations create for a nice vibe as well. Overall a great spot for good Japanese and Asian specialities :)",

          "text": "EDIT: in a more recent visit, the decline in food quality and service was both noticeable and disappointing! I would still visit Eimi again, but unfortunately I‚Äôm more likely to choose other local ramen/Japanese places from now on\n\nWe love this place! I have noticed some minor inconsistencies in the food quality at times, but I love their tonkotsu ramen and appetizers so much that it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me. They utilize a mobile ordering system, which may seem confusing on a first visit, but quickly becomes comfortable and efficient. You scan a QR code at the table to view the menu AND place your order. The staff are kind though and definitely willing to help out if you have questions or special requests/concerns. The dining area and decorations create for a nice vibe as well. Overall a great spot for good Japanese and Asian specialities :)",

          "text": "That‚Äôs quite a novel you‚Äôve written ‚Äî impressive word count, less impressive content.\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down:\n\nTiming logic ‚Äî You claim my total visit was only 53 minutes, so there‚Äôs no way the food sat for 40? Fascinating deduction. I didn‚Äôt realize this was a math competition. If your kitchen was as fast as your defensive calculations, maybe I‚Äôd have had dinner on time.\n\nSour eggs & invisible bones ‚Äî Apparently, because other customers didn‚Äôt complain, my experience must be invalid. Great! Next time I stub my toe, I‚Äôll be sure to check if 30 other people also did before speaking up.\n\nMy username = Conspiracy theory ‚Äî The idea that I‚Äôm part of some underground sushi sabotage ring is truly entertaining. Netflix-worthy, even. Spoiler: I changed the name to avoid confusion with another store, not to launch a culinary coup.\n\nLikes on my comment? Must be fake. Right. Maybe I bought them with the money I saved not ordering more of your food.\n\nThat ending line ‚Äî Telling a customer to ‚Äúnot take their bad life out on others‚Äù is bold. Therapist, philosopher, and restaurateur ‚Äî you really do it all. Perhaps open a counseling service next to your sushi bar?\n\nAnd with that said ‚Äî this will be my last reply. I have better things to do than debate sashimi conspiracies and egg-based gaslighting.\nWish you the best of luck ‚Äî you‚Äôll need it.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nAdditional note:\n\nI changed my username out of respect for another local restaurant with a similar name. This change does not mean I‚Äôm retracting or softening anything I said in my review.\n\nWhat‚Äôs even more concerning is that instead of acknowledging serious issues like sour eggs or fish bones in the sashimi, the business‚Äôs first reaction was denial and accusing me of malicious competition. I would have expected a responsible restaurant to prioritize customer safety and improve food quality control, not just respond defensively to reviews.\n\nIf the business needs help with math (e.g., pricing five buns at $13 and two buns at $4), I recommend the math courses at BYU.\n\nÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºøÔºø\n\nFirst of all, the sashimi was served warm and still had bones in it, which is completely unacceptable for raw fish. The deep-fried sushi came out cold, like it had been sitting out for a while. The shrimp in the other rolls had a strange bitter taste and an unpleasant rubbery texture. The egg in the ramen was sour, which is a huge red flag for freshness.\n\nSanitation is also a major issue. The chef wasn‚Äôt wearing gloves or a mask, and the sushi was left on the counter for 20 minutes before anyone bothered to bring it over. The buns were undercooked, with doughy, muddy-like skins that were hard to chew. The wasabi had a weird slimy consistency, and the ramen broth along with the dipping sauce were so salty they felt more like a health hazard than a meal.",

I ordered pickup and they finished my order while I was in the store, and the shrimp tempura they used in my sushi was super old, stale, rubbery, and very bitter. So bitter my husband and I both spit it out. The shredded crab they use in their rolls has no mayo added to make it a crab salad, so any roll with it is really dry and hard to eat without dunking it in sauce. There are much better places to get sushi at this same price point and cheaper in the area. I‚Äôve given this place 3 tries and each time was more disappointing than the last.",

I'm so frustrated and really debated leaving this, but if i were looking at reviews, I would want to know about this experience before choosing here to eat.\nI do not get to eat out often because it is so expensive everywhere. I decided to take my wife out on a date and splurge a little on sushi.\nThey have you place your order through on online check out system. Our server didn't explain anything to us, she was really sweet but we had to ask several times how to place our order.\nWe decided to get the all you can eat dinner, because most sushi rolls were around $10-15 and the all you can eat was just under $30 per person.\nI had planned to be around $60, which is a lot but for sushi I can justify.\nMy wife got a pot of Oolong tea, which had 1 tea bag for the entire pot and was really weak. The teapot was beautiful though.\nI'm being so honest, the sushi was not good. The only roll we got that was good was the lemon roll, and even then it was like a mid tier roll from somewhere else. The rolls were huge, not it a good way, and had so much rice, it was hard to taste anything else in the roll. The rice was so chewy. We got a fried roll, and between the thick rice and the thick batter that had soaked into the rice, it was just a really sad experience. That roll was so large and hard to chew.\nWe ordered a dessert roll for one of ours and it was just a ton of rice wrapped around a banana with a slice of strawberry on each piece.  It was so dry and really hard to eat.\nI honestly can't tell you what else we ordered, all I can remember from the other rolls is rice.\nLike most all you can eat sushi, you have to pay for anything you don't finish. So we made ourselves finish all of our rolls because we genuinely don't have the money not to. It was so frustrating to be so full after 5 rolls between the 2 of us, something I love about all you can eat sushi is getting to try multiple rolls. It felt like we were scammed and filled up on rice.\nLooking at my bill, after taxes and the 2 drinks and 2 meals, it was $70. Plus in order to leave a 15% tip was another $10.\nI ordered some Edimame and cream cheese rangoons bc I couldn't justify spending $70 on what we had eaten. The edimame was good. We forced ourselves to stay for another hour to slowly eat it to try to get more value for what we were paying.\nI genuinely went home and bawled bc of how expensive it was for bad food.  I'm so frustrated that this was a splurge for us, and the food was so bad and it was supposed to be a special occasion. I just feel so cheated.",

The staff seemed inattentive to customers and lacked professional knowledge when taking orders, making it difficult for them to recommend suitable dishes.\n\nSecond, the quality of the food did not match the price. The ramen broth was quite unpleasant, failing to highlight the natural umami flavors of the dish, and the noodles were overly hard, resulting in a poor overall experience. Additionally, I noticed the server‚Äôs fingers touching the soup while serving, which raised serious hygiene concerns.\n\nDespite the relatively high menu prices, the taste and freshness of the food were unsatisfactory. The sushi rice was too hard, and the sashimi was not fresh enough.\n\nLastly, the excessive noise further diminished the dining atmosphere, making the overall experience unpleasant.\n\nIn conclusion, this visit fell far short of expectations, and I am unlikely to return in the future.",

I think I ate WAY too much. The edamame was great, but their pan fried dumplings are to die for! We also ordered a few different rolls of sushi and all were yummy and fresh. It's an interesting ordering system where you order with a QR code on your phone, and then they bring it out to you. Personally, I liked that! I loved getting to chat with my hubs as we ordered and then had time to ourselves while it cooked. No pressure, no interruptions. But still - the staff were friendly and kind! Overall, it was a great date spot for Valentine's Day, but we also plan on coming back often.",

The eggs were cooked a little bit more than I normally like but the shoyu Ramen rich broth and flavorful noodles made up for it!\nMy husband had the curry ramen and said it was okay, the broth was lacking in flavor but the pork cutlet was very good.\nThey brought us a water pitcher so we didn't run out of water and had us order through a QR code. Some item descriptions were better than others, I wish there was a way to customize the item (I like 2 eggs in my ramen, normally) or split the check (the check updates with what everyone puts in, you can't order separately).",

Both excellent. The sushi rolls were all excellent. Very high quality and great flavor. The fish was very fresh. The Ninja and Lemonland were our favorites. They were all so good. The price is better than other sushi places in the area. Our family loved this restaurant and will definitely be back. Highly recommend!",

I'll take some when we come back, which will absolutely be soon.\n\nThey make the noodles in house and it is notable. Absolutely delicious. My 2 year old tried tonkatsu ramen for the first time and she loved it. Ate her own little bowl entirely!\n\nThe service was very very friendly. Their app to order from is probably the slickest I've used. Super easy to order and got our food it felt like within 5 minutes. Very well put together scenery and bright enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nThe sushi was insanely good too. This will be a staple in my family easily. I think my 2 year old will make sure of that!\n\nPersonally really enjoyed and glad to have a good ramen spot again.",

Used to be a good sushi for cheap place for college kids and now it feels like a place your boss would take you for lunch.\n\nMy first time going there after the remodel was my first time getting stereotyped as a student. Me and 2 other friends went during a low traffic time. I looked at the menu and asked if they still did all-you-can-eat sushi. The sever got visibly upset and said we only do high quality rolls now. I then asked what he had that was gluten free and he looked at me and then abruptly left and returned with a Gluten Free menu and stood over me as I ordered. I ended up ordering a couple rolls that were half off.\n\nThe food took more than half an hour to come out and we didn‚Äôt see the server except for when we were ordering, receiving the food and when we got the check. The food itself was over priced at 50% off and was not worth it.\n\nWhen we got the check he stood over us and watched as we filled out the receipt.",

She went to tell the manager, and he didn‚Äôt even have the decency to walk a few feet over to us to address the concern. He told the server to tell us it was the fermented kimchi, and then he walked away. We are very familiar with kimchi and know the difference between fermented and spoiled.

I have noticed some minor inconsistencies in the food quality at times, but I love their tonkotsu ramen and appetizers so much that it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me. They utilize a mobile ordering system, which may seem confusing on a first visit, but quickly becomes comfortable and efficient. You scan a QR code at the table to view the menu AND place your order. The staff are kind though and definitely willing to help out if you have questions or special requests/concerns. The dining area and decorations create for a nice vibe as well. Overall a great spot for good Japanese and Asian specialities :)",

We ordered the cream cheese wontons. They are not made with won ton skins that are light and airy when fried. These are made with some sort of thick dough, so they are hard.

I said I do too and this is clearly not it and then I asked him if he had anything else on the menu he asked me if I knew how to read the menus right there and I said wow I'm done got up and told them and this is what replaced wild Ginger? Neither I or my family will ever eat here again usually when something doesn't taste right someone will taste it I mean there was a big bowl he could have taken a spoonful of tasted it and then I'm so sorry that does not taste right I will be right back and make it right the guy really left a bad taste in my mouth literally and then wanted to end up treating me the way he did if I could get negative Stars I would",
