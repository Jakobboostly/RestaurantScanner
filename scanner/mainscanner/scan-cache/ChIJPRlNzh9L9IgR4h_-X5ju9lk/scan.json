We came in at dinner time, it was pretty empty in there so I thought our orders would come out in a decent time frame. Everyone that worked there was nice, but they forgot about us. We each ordered a pizza and wings. My friend got her wings and ate half before I got mine. A girl had to come back & ask what my wings were because the guy put it in weird in the computer. We waited a long time before I got my pizza. We finished eating our wings, eventually my friend had say something because at least 30 minutes passed and she hadn't got her pizza. I took 2 bites of my pizza, on a scale of 1 to 10 it was a 3, the sauce is not good but the rest is. Our wings were the best we ever had, though.  Perfectly crispy and amazing seasoning. My friend finally gets her pizza. We got our pizzas boxed to go. The girl did give us some cheesecake for the wait. I don't mind the wait, I'm explaining our experience. I'll be back, but just for the wings.",

This time when I ordered the wings, the same female cook working there made it salty again. I let her know this time and then she corrected me saying this is what lemon pepper wings are supposed to taste like. I am very disappointed. I loved going to this restaurant for years.

First i was overcharged until i asked for total again. Ordered two combos. Small pep w. Green peppers, 6pc wing  lem pepper and large drink. 2nd combo small pepp w. Grn peppers and large drink family fry. Got there one pizzas were wrong no bell peppers.  They gave me burned fries on top and bottom and I know they knew it b.c I saw it as soon as box opened. So i  said ill be nice. I asked the girl at window to take them out and dont throw fries away ill still eat them..there was no seasoning like they normally do but I said. I got some lawrys at home. No problem.  Sent them.both bk. Got another pizza that looked like someone rushed. Threw it in the oven . So I asked for my receipt. I was told it's emailed. I told the girl I would call the owner in the morning b.c I had NEVER experienced this type of service before. Younger man. That resembled older owners - son potentially asked what's wrong. He... Said he was the owner. I  explained the burned fries which he already knew about. Showed him pizza and he nonchalantly asked me what was wrong. I couldn't do anything but laugh. Pizza was not round as normal it was exceptionally thin. No apology for the quality.  Service or anything and looked at me like I was unreasonable and asked did I want a refund. Normally I do and give food back and drive away and provide my terrible experience via reviews, which I will still do. But my son asked me for this so this time I kept the terribly made food. But I won't be back. I AM REALLY SADDENED THAT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE  and quality IS HARD TO FIND ANYMORE.",

This was 4 hrs after the business was opened for the day so this business rather lose money because the can't take a $100.00 bill This is the very reason I don't deal with many black owned business. If this would have been a white business they would have made all kinda accommodations to service me now I see why I have always passed this business and never stopped. The cashier wasn't friendly or helpful @ all. So if you decide to pay with a $100.00 bill take your money somewhere else because they don't have any change.ü§î",

Also the associates don't know their current promotions. At the time of this review you can indeed get 2 2 topping large pizzas for 23$. According to the associates that deal expired. This was supposed to be my cheat day. But I couldn't eat it. Ended up giving the crust to the dog and throwing it away.",

The manager asked me how was everything and I showed her the pizza presentation before I began eating, sure she asked because of the look on my face when I opened the box, and she defended the presentation saying, and I quote \"It's because we make the dough here fresh.\" Ummm, I've had freshly made pizza that didn't come out looking like pizza night at home with the kids.  The toppings were unevenly distributed, and as a result so was the taste and flavors in every bite. It was good individually: good sauce, good dough, good chicken, canned pineapple to be expected. Just need to train the cook a little more with the execution. To the manager's credit, she offered to remake it but, I was hungry.",

            "text": "Everything. I have patronized this business  for years with my son. It was one of his most fav. Places. But now it will be. A memory. I ordered my food around 817p. First i was overcharged until i asked for total again. Ordered two combos. Small pep w. Green peppers, 6pc wing  lem pepper and large drink. 2nd combo small pepp w. Grn peppers and large drink family fry. Got there one pizzas were wrong no bell peppers.  They gave me burned fries on top and bottom and I know they knew it b.c I saw it as soon as box opened. So i  said ill be nice. I asked the girl at window to take them out and dont throw fries away ill still eat them..there was no seasoning like they normally do but I said. I got some lawrys at home. No problem.  Sent them.both bk. Got another pizza that looked like someone rushed. Threw it in the oven . So I asked for my receipt. I was told it's emailed. I told the girl I would call the owner in the morning b.c I had NEVER experienced this type of service before. Younger man. That resembled older owners - son potentially asked what's wrong. He... Said he was the owner. I  explained the burned fries which he already knew about. Showed him pizza and he nonchalantly asked me what was wrong. I couldn't do anything but laugh. Pizza was not round as normal it was exceptionally thin. No apology for the quality.  Service or anything and looked at me like I was unreasonable and asked did I want a refund. Normally I do and give food back and drive away and provide my terrible experience via reviews, which I will still do. But my son asked me for this so this time I kept the terribly made food. But I won't be back. I AM REALLY SADDENED THAT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE  and quality IS HARD TO FIND ANYMORE.",
