The seafood pasta was phenomenal - perfectly cooked shrimp and what appeared to be lobster or crab over delicate angel hair in a rich, creamy sauce, with fresh dill that added a lovely herbal note complementing the seafood beautifully. The clams were fresh and briny, cooked just right, and even the soup was expertly prepared with great depth of flavor. The plating is restaurant-quality beautiful with expertly crafted martinis that were clean and well-balanced. Everything about the experience felt upscale and refined - you can tell they use quality ingredients and have skilled preparation. This is definitely a place I'll be returning to, and for seafood lovers in OKC, Rococo on Western is a must-try. The combination of exceptional flavors, beautiful presentation, and upscale atmosphere makes it a standout dining destination that I highly recommend for special occasions or when you want to treat yourself to outstanding seafood!",

Bartender even made us a fruity micktail that was not on menu. We ordered Grilled cheese sandwiches with fries for kids. We started with Sharkuterie which is great is you want a sample of most like\nshark sausage, seared tuna, salmon\npastrami, snow crab claws, octopus. For main we had catch of the day which was red fish blackened on a red of dirty rice and charred broccolini. Also had Lamb T- Bones with couscous. These two were decent but not memorable, seemed to be lacking some flavor somewhere. For dessert we had the chocolate. mousse which was pretty good! Overall great atmosphere, freshest sea food and great service! Would recommend.",

          "text": "Had an absolutely wonderful dinner at Rococo on Western and the taste was amazing! This upscale seafood restaurant truly delivers on both presentation and flavor. The seafood pasta was phenomenal - perfectly cooked shrimp and what appeared to be lobster or crab over delicate angel hair in a rich, creamy sauce, with fresh dill that added a lovely herbal note complementing the seafood beautifully. The clams were fresh and briny, cooked just right, and even the soup was expertly prepared with great depth of flavor. The plating is restaurant-quality beautiful with expertly crafted martinis that were clean and well-balanced. Everything about the experience felt upscale and refined - you can tell they use quality ingredients and have skilled preparation. This is definitely a place I'll be returning to, and for seafood lovers in OKC, Rococo on Western is a must-try. The combination of exceptional flavors, beautiful presentation, and upscale atmosphere makes it a standout dining destination that I highly recommend for special occasions or when you want to treat yourself to outstanding seafood!",

Bartender even made us a fruity micktail that was not on menu. We ordered Grilled cheese sandwiches with fries for kids. We started with Sharkuterie which is great is you want a sample of most like\nshark sausage, seared tuna, salmon\npastrami, snow crab claws, octopus. For main we had catch of the day which was red fish blackened on a red of dirty rice and charred broccolini. Also had Lamb T- Bones with couscous. These two were decent but not memorable, seemed to be lacking some flavor somewhere. For dessert we had the chocolate. mousse which was pretty good! Overall great atmosphere, freshest sea food and great service! Would recommend.",

I've never seen anyone treat seafood with this much respect. It's more than food; it's a work of art.\n\nI used to work here, and Bruce and Jason were the best bosses I‚Äôve ever had. They treated their team like family, and that same warmth shows in every dish and every guest interaction. The wine list is top-notch, the food is true fine dining, and the vibe is unforgettable.\n\nIf you care about food‚Äîeven a little‚Äîyou owe yourself a visit.",

I loved that it was literally chunks of crab barely held together. I wish there had been more sauce‚Äîwhatever the crab cake was sitting on top of. I ordered the catch of the day which was the mahi mahi. Loved the broccolini, nice and charred. Husband ordered the fisherman‚Äôs platter.
