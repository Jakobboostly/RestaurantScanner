The fries were really good, much better than what I expected.   They had all of the crispy nooks and crannies and were perfectly cooked.  The burger was good, but not gourmet.  The portion is very generous for the price.  They use frozen patties, so it is not as tender as fresh beef, but overall,  it was good. I got onions on mine, and they grilled the onions (which I was not expecting), and they gave a very generous portion.   I went in the middle of the afternoon and picked it up myself so I could make sure everything was in the bag.  The staff was pleasant and double-checked my order before they bagged it.  I have been there twice now, and the experience has been consistent.  Reasonable priced quick food, and it tasted great.  The only con was the laughably small piece of cheese on the burger.  Other than that, no complaints.",

The fries were really good, much better than what I expected.   They had all of the crispy nooks and crannies and were perfectly cooked.  The burger was good, but not gourmet.  The portion is very generous for the price.  They use frozen patties, so it is not as tender as fresh beef, but overall,  it was good. I got onions on mine, and they grilled the onions (which I was not expecting), and they gave a very generous portion.   I went in the middle of the afternoon and picked it up myself so I could make sure everything was in the bag.  The staff was pleasant and double-checked my order before they bagged it.  I have been there twice now, and the experience has been consistent.  Reasonable priced quick food, and it tasted great.  The only con was the laughably small piece of cheese on the burger.  Other than that, no complaints.",
