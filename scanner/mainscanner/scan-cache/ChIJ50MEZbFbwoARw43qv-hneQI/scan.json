          "text": "What an absolute treat! I wanted to take my family out after a long day at the racetrack and thought a nice dinner would fit the bill.\n\nLa Papillon delivered!\n\nWe started with their home-made bread (Amazing) and decided to do a round of Oysters. I don't eat oysters but I took a gamble and gave it a shot and it was a nice balance of salty and mild sweetness with that oyster twist that makes them so addicting.\n\nWhen it came to the main event I went with the Ribeye. It came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. The steak was great in that it had good flavor, texture, and it also came with fried onions on top as well as a side of Red Wine & Mushroom sauce. The sauce was a nice touch but I didn't need much of it.\n\nThe family ended up getting pasta dishes and were very happy with their selections.\n\nThat night was especially nice because they had a singer who executed classics from Sinatra and Englebert Humperdinck but the cherry on top was that he NAILED a sinatra-esque version of the Spiderman theme song. My 16 y.o. son was so impressed that he went up and tipped the guy.\n\nOn top of the great soundtrack to our dinner the ambiance of the place is very nice. It was a nice mix of classic materials with a modern and clean execution.\n\nLastly, the service was great too. We were well cared for and our server answered all or questions and pointed us to all the right selections for food & drink.\n\nI was not expecting to have such a great dining experience!",

My favorite was the La papillon salad and the chipotle chicken pasta. Husband got the chicken roulade, was a bit too salty for me but husband liked it , the ahi tower was good but I could do without the hoisin sauce drizzle and the capers personally. Husband loved the complimentary bread. We got the chocolate cake and peach cobbler for dessert, Cho ate cake was 10/10 very rich and the peach cobbler could‚Äôve used brown shut on the crumble was a tad plain but the peaches and ice cream balanced it but I have a sweet tooth l, overall would def come back again!",

I wanted to take my family out after a long day at the racetrack and thought a nice dinner would fit the bill.\n\nLa Papillon delivered!\n\nWe started with their home-made bread (Amazing) and decided to do a round of Oysters. I don't eat oysters but I took a gamble and gave it a shot and it was a nice balance of salty and mild sweetness with that oyster twist that makes them so addicting.\n\nWhen it came to the main event I went with the Ribeye. It came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. The steak was great in that it had good flavor, texture, and it also came with fried onions on top as well as a side of Red Wine & Mushroom sauce. The sauce was a nice touch but I didn't need much of it.\n\nThe family ended up getting pasta dishes and were very happy with their selections.\n\nThat night was especially nice because they had a singer who executed classics from Sinatra and Englebert Humperdinck but the cherry on top was that he NAILED a sinatra-esque version of the Spiderman theme song. My 16 y.o. son was so impressed that he went up and tipped the guy.\n\nOn top of the great soundtrack to our dinner the ambiance of the place is very nice. It was a nice mix of classic materials with a modern and clean execution.\n\nLastly, the service was great too. We were well cared for and our server answered all or questions and pointed us to all the right selections for food & drink.\n\nI was not expecting to have such a great dining experience!",

My favorite was the La papillon salad and the chipotle chicken pasta. Husband got the chicken roulade, was a bit too salty for me but husband liked it , the ahi tower was good but I could do without the hoisin sauce drizzle and the capers personally. Husband loved the complimentary bread. We got the chocolate cake and peach cobbler for dessert, Cho ate cake was 10/10 very rich and the peach cobbler could‚Äôve used brown shut on the crumble was a tad plain but the peaches and ice cream balanced it but I have a sweet tooth l, overall would def come back again!",

Even so, the place was serene and clean.\nDue to my allergies, I was not able to try everything.
