I walked to the restaurant and arrived about 2 minutes before my order was supposed to be ready. The place was completely empty and the front door was locked. I called the restaurant and someone hung up on me. I called a second time and asked whether the place was open. The owner replied ‚ÄúUgh, yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù in a condescending tone, as if I were crazy for asking. I informed him his front door was locked.\n\nWhen the owner came to open the door, another delivery driver had arrived. We walked into the empty restaurant and the owner told the delivery driver, ‚ÄúYour order will be ready in about 4 minutes, you can have a seat.‚Äù He told me, ‚ÄúYour order will be ready in about 6 minutes, please wait outside.‚Äù I asked him whether it was necessary for me to go outside and he told me that when an order takes more than 6 minutes to complete, he asks people to wait in their car. I wanted to explain to him that I didn‚Äôt have a car and that I‚Äôm a returning customer from the neighborhood, but he stormed off after he finished his statement.\n\nAgain, the restaurant was empty. There were plenty of empty chairs. Instead, I stood outside his front door and nobody came to inform me my order was ready.\n\nThis owner seems checked out.",

They look a bit like a croissant ü•ê but that's where the similarities end. They are in actuality, Garlic bread with Pepperoni and cheese folded and baked to damn near perfection.  Worth driving there just to try these, but you'd be missing out on great pizza if you just did that. Go now...literally.",

I order delivery regularly and it always is correct & delivered earlier than the ETA.\nI got the 8 slice Detroit style with giardinara & the cheesysticks and both were üî•üî•. & yes, all that was just for me, even though I was beyond full after a few breadsticks & a slice. With delivery fee, tax, and tip it was ~$40 and I'll get at least 3 meals out of it. Cheaper than Jets with a crispier crust, which I love.",

It is a shame because I just moved to the area and I am all for supporting small businesses, however simply not letting delivery drivers use the bathroom when customers can use the bathroom is not OK because at the end of the day without the delivery drivers those customers would not be ordering from your store I guess since we are 1099 workers with that exact same logic, you are using as the owner that I guess if some construction workers are doing some work in your shop or if anyone else is doing work to improve your shop who aren‚Äôt your employees and are customers I guess they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to use the bathroom either which would be ridiculous. You not letting construction workers working on your own shop to use your bathroom because they are not your employees. Let‚Äôs do the math how much money you lost out on me and my roommates eat out about twice a week at least for pizza. Multiply an extra large pizza by the amount of weeks in a year and that‚Äôs how much money you lost. Which is easily thousands of dollars. I also told the customer they didn‚Äôt let me use the bathroom and they instructed me over the phone they would no longer order from your shop. With that attitude hopefully you will close soon rather get little Cesar‚Äôs then you guys.",

I called the restaurant and someone hung up on me. I called a second time and asked whether the place was open. The owner replied ‚ÄúUgh, yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù in a condescending tone, as if I were crazy for asking. I informed him his front door was locked.\n\nWhen the owner came to open the door, another delivery driver had arrived. We walked into the empty restaurant and the owner told the delivery driver, ‚ÄúYour order will be ready in about 4 minutes, you can have a seat.‚Äù He told me, ‚ÄúYour order will be ready in about 6 minutes, please wait outside.‚Äù I asked him whether it was necessary for me to go outside and he told me that when an order takes more than 6 minutes to complete, he asks people to wait in their car. I wanted to explain to him that I didn‚Äôt have a car and that I‚Äôm a returning customer from the neighborhood, but he stormed off after he finished his statement.\n\nAgain, the restaurant was empty. There were plenty of empty chairs. Instead, I stood outside his front door and nobody came to inform me my order was ready.\n\nThis owner seems checked out.",

This is a winning strategy I'm sure.\n\nThanks for taking my money though. I'm sure I'll never see the refund you promised for the hot dog that ended up in the trash with the poppers, and for ruining my dinner after working a 12 hour shift.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe‚Äôve ordered from here occasionally for the last three years. Tonight will be the last. Before we always ordered pizza and had no issues, but tonight decided on hot dogs and appetizers instead.\n\nThe Chicago dog bun was stale and the jalape√±o poppers had hair in the ranch dressing and was in the package with the poppers.\n\nI did call about the hot dog and they offered to refund that. Unfortunately I went to try the poppers afterwards and found the hair.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry but this is so gross and unacceptable, we will never be back.",
