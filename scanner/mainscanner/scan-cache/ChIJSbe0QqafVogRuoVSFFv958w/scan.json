Alternatively, 7+ dollars per slice.\nI ordered a large pie to get a fresh pizza tasted as the slices were sitting out.\nSadly,  the pizza lacked a quality ingredients taste and feel. The cheese has no stretch and felt dry,, the pie itself had very little sauce, which also attributed to its dry feel. The dough was cooked and browned on the bottom. However, it lacked crunch, it had more of a moist doughy texture/feel.\nOverall,  mediocre pizza compared to an authentic Italian pizzeria, I would compare it to frozen supermarket pizza, perhaps one step up because if it is colossal size\nFirst and last time visit.",
