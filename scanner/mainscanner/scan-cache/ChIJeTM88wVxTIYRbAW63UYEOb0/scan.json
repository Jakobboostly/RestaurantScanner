We ordered the strawberry matcha and a savory crepe to share. The matcha was good but I would prefer real strawberries rather than just strawberry syrup. Like I said it was good but the syrup almost tasted more like raspberries. The crepe was cooked to perfection and it was way bigger than expected. Like I said, we had to share it. The savory crepe with turkey, avocado, mushrooms, eggs, tomato. Service is up front at the counter and they brought the drinks and food to us. Great for small and large groups and a place to study.  I would like to come back if I‚Äôm in the area and try the other crepe options. Till then, let‚Äôs eat!",

The wait for basic french toast was a bit much but hey, the presentation was nice and the frappes were made perfectly....until they weren't. I guess my first few visits I was lucky but afterwards, the place's service went down hill extremely fast. 20 minutes. No one should have to sit in a drive thru lane for 20 minutes just for you to drizzle syrup on 2 slices of thin bread. And this isn't a one time thing. I constantly wait at least 10-15 minutes in the drive thru lane and there is NO ONE else around. I can make french toast in under 10 minutes tops. The frappes are no longer good. Extremely watery and no longer created the way they were the first few times I had them. This one visit, I asked if they could make it thick since it is basically water by the time i get home. The girl added a giant wad of ice to it which lost any flavor i had paid to taste. so now i just have thick icy flavored water and basic french toast that took almost half an hour to make. You can take a mini nap in the drive thru and wake up and still not have your order ready. I was able to accomplish that today. Food and drink were both tossed out and I'm heading to CFA where consistency never fails. This is the last time i give my money to this place. Consistency is key, please work on it for your other customers.",

          "text": "My friend and I are out here looking for a good yap cafe with matcha and we found it. We were pleasantly surprised with the location; very aesthetic and giving off European vibes. We ordered the strawberry matcha and a savory crepe to share. The matcha was good but I would prefer real strawberries rather than just strawberry syrup. Like I said it was good but the syrup almost tasted more like raspberries. The crepe was cooked to perfection and it was way bigger than expected. Like I said, we had to share it. The savory crepe with turkey, avocado, mushrooms, eggs, tomato. Service is up front at the counter and they brought the drinks and food to us. Great for small and large groups and a place to study.  I would like to come back if I‚Äôm in the area and try the other crepe options. Till then, let‚Äôs eat!",

          "text": "Me and my husband‚Äôs first time having crepes. They were pretty good but since I‚Äôm a texture eater the layers threw me off a little. The flavor was definitely there.\n\nWe tried‚Ä¶.\n-Chicken Pesto(really good and savory, a must try)\n-Banana Foster(not too sweet but also really good and lite)\n-Breakfast Special(not my fav only because I like my eggs scramble. It was my husbands favorite)\n-Honey bee iced latte(not too sweet but good!)\n-Snickerdoodle hot latte(Really Sweet! taste just like a snickerdoodle lol. They definitely got the flavor down with this one!)\n\nThe crepe was really big and generously stuffed.\nIn my opinion the pricing was fair for what we received. Roughly $10-$14 per crepe.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, the place was clean, gives a French vide and we had our 9mth old with us so the highchairs were a huge plus!\n\nThe staff were friendly and welcoming. I believe the gentleman that took our order was the owner maybe. We let him know it was our first time and he gave recommendations.\n\nI noticed on the way out they had monthly specials. I‚Äôll definitely be back for the wild berry frappe!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThey have a drive through btw‚Ä¶",

However, when I took my first sip, I found the milkshake to be overwhelmingly chocolate-forward, leaving little room for the classic Oreo flavor I was hoping for. The thick drizzle of chocolate syrup at the bottom and the dollop on top of the whipped cream felt excessive and overshadowed the drink‚Äôs true essence. To my dismay, the Oreo pieces were virtually nonexistent, losing their crunch and character in the mix. At $6.50, I felt it was an unfair price for something I could easily find elsewhere for half the cost. Overall, this experience was a disappointing ‚Äúhard pass‚Äù for me.",

It seems like a family-owned business, and the person at the counter was very customer-friendly. The beautiful, clean white theme adds to the inviting atmosphere. I ordered some seasonal coffee, and it tasted excellent. The food snacks looked very appealing, though I didn‚Äôt get a chance to try them this time. I plan to visit again for the crepes, and the items on the counter seem promising for a good taste. The overall vibe is awesome, and I would love to come back and recommend it to others.",

From the moment it arrives at your table, the vibrant colors of the fresh berries catch your eye. Each bite is a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness, complemented by the light, fluffy crepe that melts in your mouth.\n\nPairing perfectly with the crepe is their delicious iced coffee, which is smooth and refreshing, providing just the right kick to balance the sweetness of the dish. The rich flavor of the coffee enhances the overall experience, making it an ideal match.\n\nThe presentation of the crepe is as impressive as the flavor, showcasing a beautiful arrangement of seasonal berries, topped with a dusting of powdered sugar. The chef‚Äôs attention to detail truly shines through. Whether you‚Äôre enjoying it for breakfast or dessert, this combination is a must-try.\n\nThe warm, welcoming atmosphere of Salomay makes the experience even more enjoyable. I can‚Äôt recommend their berry crepe and iced coffee highly enough‚Äîboth are delicious treats that will leave you craving more!",

The wait for basic french toast was a bit much but hey, the presentation was nice and the frappes were made perfectly....until they weren't. I guess my first few visits I was lucky but afterwards, the place's service went down hill extremely fast. 20 minutes. No one should have to sit in a drive thru lane for 20 minutes just for you to drizzle syrup on 2 slices of thin bread. And this isn't a one time thing. I constantly wait at least 10-15 minutes in the drive thru lane and there is NO ONE else around. I can make french toast in under 10 minutes tops. The frappes are no longer good. Extremely watery and no longer created the way they were the first few times I had them. This one visit, I asked if they could make it thick since it is basically water by the time i get home. The girl added a giant wad of ice to it which lost any flavor i had paid to taste. so now i just have thick icy flavored water and basic french toast that took almost half an hour to make. You can take a mini nap in the drive thru and wake up and still not have your order ready. I was able to accomplish that today. Food and drink were both tossed out and I'm heading to CFA where consistency never fails. This is the last time i give my money to this place. Consistency is key, please work on it for your other customers.",
