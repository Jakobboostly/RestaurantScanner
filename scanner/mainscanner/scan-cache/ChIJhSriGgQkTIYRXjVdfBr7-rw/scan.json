The good thing about the chicken pho is that it has its own broth; they don't use the same one as the combination. Many pho places are lazy and just use beef broth for chicken pho, but not this place; they go all out on their soup. I definitely recommend this place; you won't be disappointed.",

The food itself wasn‚Äôt good either, it was super bland even after adding things to it. I love trying new pho places so I‚Äôve been to a lot, but I can see why they don‚Äôt get much business unfortunately. I really hope they are able to improve in the future.",

I ordered one bowl of pho with two types of meat and a fried rice, and even double-checked with the server to make sure the order was correct. She confirmed it, but when the food arrived, there were two bowls of pho.\n\nWhen I politely pointed out the mistake, she sighed right in front of me, even though it was her error. Later, when I asked for an extra plate, she sighed again with a strange facial expression that made the interaction uncomfortable.\n\nGood food, but the unprofessional service really took away from the experience.",

I placed a to-go order in an almost empty restaurant, with only one other person dining in. I tipped the default 20%, assuming the experience would go smoothly. It didn‚Äôt.\n\nMy order was brought out and left next to a larger to-go order without any notification. After waiting 25 minutes, I asked for an update, and the staff found my order‚Äîsitting there the whole time. Cold.\n\nThere‚Äôs a small sign on the counter that reads ‚ÄúRing for Help,‚Äù which honestly reflects the overall attitude: customer service is clearly not a priority. The space itself was dirty and looked run-down. Not what you‚Äôd expect or hope for in a dining experience.\n\nAs for the food‚Äîmediocre at best, especially cold. The herbs weren‚Äôt washed properly, and the protein portions were small despite ordering a large.\n\nThere are far better options in town that are just a short drive away. I won‚Äôt be returning.",

The pho broth is rich and flavorful, with the perfect balance of aromatics and depth. The noodles are cooked just right, and the meat is always tender and fresh. I also tried the NS3 Bo Kho and A1 Cha Gio - crispy egg roll. Both were fantastic!\n\nThe service is friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. If you‚Äôre looking for authentic Vietnamese food that hits the spot every time, this is the place. Highly recommend!",

My order of Beef Stew came with little to no meat, only one piece of a large clump of fat was included (and it had *hints* of beef on it).  I was very  disappointed because the broth was so flavorful.  If I were in the store, I don't feel like they would have done me like this.\n\nEdit to my review based on response received  from restaurant ‚Ä¶\n\nThe description of my meal was this :\n\nFlavorful simmered beef broth and TENDER BEEF CUBES with daikon and carrot‚Ä¶\n\nI received ZERO meat other than the small amounts attached to the beef tendon ( which was not listed in the description ). The person preparing the dish provided almost zero meat in the ‚Äústew‚Äù.   I cut open the tendon to eat as much meat as possible but I felt like Tiny Tim‚Äôs family when they were shaving the bean into portions.",

My partner and I love it so much that we come at least once a week--it's become a bit of a tradition for us!\n\nThe experience isn't just about the food, though. The owner and his family are incredibly warm and welcoming, and they truly make you feel like a part of their extended family. We were lucky enough to chat with the owner one evening, and he shared a bit of the restaurant's backstory with us. He mentioned that it took them years to perfect the broth, and I can tell--they absolutely nailed it. Hearing about his journey was a treat; he's laid-back, super friendly, and clearly passionate about the food he serves.\n\nThe establishment itself is always spotless--something I really appreciate. You can tell they take pride in maintaining a clean, inviting space for their guests. Now, onto the star of the show: the pho. Oh my goodness! I always order the pho with no meat, spice level 3, in a small bowl. Every time, the flavors blow me away. The broth is rich and aromatic, with just the right amount of spice that warms you up without overpowering the other ingredients. The balance of flavors is incredible--it's comforting, fresh, and so satisfying. This bowl of pho is simply a little slice of heaven.",
