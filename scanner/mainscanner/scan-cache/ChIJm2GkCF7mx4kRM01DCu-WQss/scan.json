Bread is soggy and done. All you had to do was put what‚Äôs cold in a small separate bag and stop putting toppings on the bottom. I also didn‚Äôt get any sauce for the wings i ordered.

BUT, the wings are definitely not tossed in the sauce, it's like they put the wings in the box and they drizzle a spoonful of sauce on them. Also, unfortunately the wings were burnt/ blackened, very small compared to many other places I normally go and I had to pull a handful of little feathers from a few unlike other places. The pizza wasn't exactly bad but just tasted a little over salty for some reason? I used to love the place when they first opened years ago, even they had the like 30 some odd wing flavors but after they changed it was never the same. I decided to go back and try them out again since it had been forever ago I was last there and unfortunately tonight I was disappointed. I will certainly try the cheese steak and another pizza before deciding to completely avoid the place but don't see me every buying wings again sadly. Maybe it was an off night? but they just have never been the same as when they first opened.",

BUT, the wings are definitely not tossed in the sauce, it's like they put the wings in the box and they drizzle a spoonful of sauce on them. Also, unfortunately the wings were burnt/ blackened, very small compared to many other places I normally go and I had to pull a handful of little feathers from a few unlike other places. The pizza wasn't exactly bad but just tasted a little over salty for some reason? I used to love the place when they first opened years ago, even they had the like 30 some odd wing flavors but after they changed it was never the same. I decided to go back and try them out again since it had been forever ago I was last there and unfortunately tonight I was disappointed. I will certainly try the cheese steak and another pizza before deciding to completely avoid the place but don't see me every buying wings again sadly. Maybe it was an off night? but they just have never been the same as when they first opened.",
