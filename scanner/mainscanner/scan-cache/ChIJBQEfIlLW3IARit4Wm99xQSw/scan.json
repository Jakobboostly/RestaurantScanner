          "text": "UPDATE:  8/14/25\nI had a nice conversation with the owner (I think it was) about their system, the pizza having all the goodies in the middle, etc. as described last month. He was very apologetic. This time, everything went well. We didn't, though, try using the automated system or delivery, but ordered directly through their website and picked it up. The pizza was back to its normal, great self.  Thanks for hearing me, Pepz. We'll give the automated way a try again eventually. üòâ\n7/14/25 Sadly disappointed...\nWe have been going there, ordering for delivery or pick up, for decades and have always loved the pizza there. Now AI answers the phone when you call. AI doesn't know what a medium special is, so you have to keep asking for it using different words until AI gets it right.  And it leads you to believe it is adding several pizzas to the order, when it's not.  There is no option to pay over the phone anymore. The delivery person was very nice, but they have a new payment system that doesn't work well...lots is steps to just add a top and pay. Neither Clover nor Square are so complex. We ordered the 16\" which used to be large, as we found out when we saw how big it was in person.  About 3\" of crust along the edge has scarce to no toppings.  The slice pictured actually has an olive or two in the area, which was unusual. It was like they used the same amount of toppings as they would for a medium and put it on a large crust.\nIt used to be so easy to order, pay and have it delivered, and the pizza used to be exceptional. I hope they ditch AI and go back to the easy, efficient way they had before and return to making quality pizzas that have toppings all the way to the edge.",

          "text": "UPDATE:  8/14/25\nI had a nice conversation with the owner (I think it was) about their system, the pizza having all the goodies in the middle, etc. as described last month. He was very apologetic. This time, everything went well. We didn't, though, try using the automated system or delivery, but ordered directly through their website and picked it up. The pizza was back to its normal, great self.  Thanks for hearing me, Pepz. We'll give the automated way a try again eventually. üòâ\n7/14/25 Sadly disappointed...\nWe have been going there, ordering for delivery or pick up, for decades and have always loved the pizza there. Now AI answers the phone when you call. AI doesn't know what a medium special is, so you have to keep asking for it using different words until AI gets it right.  And it leads you to believe it is adding several pizzas to the order, when it's not.  There is no option to pay over the phone anymore. The delivery person was very nice, but they have a new payment system that doesn't work well...lots is steps to just add a top and pay. Neither Clover nor Square are so complex. We ordered the 16\" which used to be large, as we found out when we saw how big it was in person.  About 3\" of crust along the edge has scarce to no toppings.  The slice pictured actually has an olive or two in the area, which was unusual. It was like they used the same amount of toppings as they would for a medium and put it on a large crust.\nIt used to be so easy to order, pay and have it delivered, and the pizza used to be exceptional. I hope they ditch AI and go back to the easy, efficient way they had before and return to making quality pizzas that have toppings all the way to the edge.",

          "text": "Food was so good! I got a 8 inch of pepperoni and the wings were amazing. Only complaint I could have is the manager and customer service! My friend got the lunch special it didn‚Äôt really specify what time they do there lunch special as there‚Äôs no times on the menu. She had gotten her two slices of pizza and they were very stale and cold. I got my wings first but waited a good 10 minutes for my pizza and drink that I ordered with my wings. When my pizza had came out I let the food runner know that my friends pizza tasted very old. He said that they make their pizza at 11 and that‚Äôs just how it is. And all they do is warm it up in a microwave. That‚Äôs totally fine if that‚Äôs the case but my friend did not want to eat that pizza and no where were we told the pizza was going to be stale and 4 hours old. That could definately be our fault being tourists and not knowing the time they make there pizzas at for lunch special but I don‚Äôt really think anyone would ever pay $12 for stale cold pizza even if it is a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù so we had let the manager know what was going on and instead of helping us find a solution she was just kind of like maybe get here earlier next time. I told her my friend isn‚Äôt going to eat it, we didn‚Äôt mind paying for the side salad and drink. She ended up leaving for a good 10-15 minutes to figure on the kiosk out how to adjust the check to charge us $7 for the drink and side salad. Like I said it was our idea to pay for the two and just get the pizza out of there but I do feel like good customer service would be to say ‚Äúhey the side salad and drink is on us today since you received cold and stale pizza!‚Äù I spent a good $40 on tipping them, a drink, wings, and pizza. Whereas my other friend also spent atleast $20 on wings and potatoes. Just a shame because the food was awesome but I don‚Äôt understand why businesses treat younger people like they don‚Äôt matter sometimes. But other than that I loved the place!!",

But what really sets this place apart are the people. Eric and Leslie are absolute gems!!! Everyone was warm, welcoming, and clearly passionate about what they do.\n\nThe vibes are just right, relaxed, friendly, and full of good energy. You can feel the pride in every detail. If you‚Äôre looking for amazing pizza and even better service, this is the spot.\n\nHighly recommend!",

Throwing things at each other. I was hit with a napkin ball that was thrown at someone from the bathroom. Plus this is post to be a bar. How can you have so many teenagers in here. I told the gentleman at the front that I was very upset about this nonsense. He just kind of shrugged it off like it happens all the time. I packed up the rest of my food and left.",

            "text": "Food was so good! I got a 8 inch of pepperoni and the wings were amazing. Only complaint I could have is the manager and customer service! My friend got the lunch special it didn‚Äôt really specify what time they do there lunch special as there‚Äôs no times on the menu. She had gotten her two slices of pizza and they were very stale and cold. I got my wings first but waited a good 10 minutes for my pizza and drink that I ordered with my wings. When my pizza had came out I let the food runner know that my friends pizza tasted very old. He said that they make their pizza at 11 and that‚Äôs just how it is. And all they do is warm it up in a microwave. That‚Äôs totally fine if that‚Äôs the case but my friend did not want to eat that pizza and no where were we told the pizza was going to be stale and 4 hours old. That could definately be our fault being tourists and not knowing the time they make there pizzas at for lunch special but I don‚Äôt really think anyone would ever pay $12 for stale cold pizza even if it is a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù so we had let the manager know what was going on and instead of helping us find a solution she was just kind of like maybe get here earlier next time. I told her my friend isn‚Äôt going to eat it, we didn‚Äôt mind paying for the side salad and drink. She ended up leaving for a good 10-15 minutes to figure on the kiosk out how to adjust the check to charge us $7 for the drink and side salad. Like I said it was our idea to pay for the two and just get the pizza out of there but I do feel like good customer service would be to say ‚Äúhey the side salad and drink is on us today since you received cold and stale pizza!‚Äù I spent a good $40 on tipping them, a drink, wings, and pizza. Whereas my other friend also spent atleast $20 on wings and potatoes. Just a shame because the food was awesome but I don‚Äôt understand why businesses treat younger people like they don‚Äôt matter sometimes. But other than that I loved the place!!",
