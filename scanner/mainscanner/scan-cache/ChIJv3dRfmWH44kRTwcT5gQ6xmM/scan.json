Their pizza is excellent, although I recommend asking for it ‚Äúwell done‚Äù if you don‚Äôt like a doughy pizza. I absolutely love their crust and their sauce. Personally, I prefer their simpler pizzas (cheese or cheese with pineapple are my go to orders), but their specialty pizzas are good, too. The pizzas are a little sweet, but the sauce does an excellent job balancing everything out.\n\nThe staff are friendly and polite. Like others have mentioned, there is no seating inside and this is a take out only place!",

The dough is light and tastes fresh. I rotate between here and Rocco‚Äôs as they are my two favorites in the area and give you a nice variety.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting flavors which I like. The Fig & Pig is hands down my favorite out of the 4 types I‚Äôve tried so far but I have enjoyed them all. The fig adds a unique flavor and a nice balance of sweet and savory.\nI also would recommend Truffle Mushroom, BBQ Brisket and BBQ Chicken Bacon. I did feel the BBQ Brisket could have had a few more toppings, and the chicken was maybe a little dry on the BBQ chicken but still very good.\n\nThe one menu item I personally would caution against is the wings as they were quite a letdown for me. I love hot honey but the Hot Honey wings were very plain and all the honey just pooled at the bottom of the container and didn‚Äôt stick to the wings. The Jamaican jerk wings were slightly better but the sauce tasted like it was from a bottle. The quality of the bone-in wings themself were also lacking.\n\nNote: I would also really recommend signing up for their rewards as they might be the most generous rewards for a restaurant I‚Äôve seen (10% back every purchase). It also helps that you order locally online through their website instead of through other online ordering platforms.",
