No one said these burgers were flame-grilled like Burger King and completely unseasoned. Cajun fries had no salt and the catfish was also unseasoned. The guy who took our orders was nice, but he was kinda weird and started while we ate. Almost like he was seeing if we liked the food. Trust me, it‚Äôs beyond mediocre. If you like or must eat unseasoned food, this might be a place for you. But by NO means should this pop up in Google‚Äôs answers when one searches best burgers in Dallas. No thank you. Lemon pepper wings were the best thing and were about a 3.5 out of 5. Fried pickles were a 1 with nasty batter. Everything was made fresh though. However, these reviews and pictures are deceiving, and the food is tasteless and expensive.",

How are frozen tater tots and a small drink the same price? Doubled the total for what? It's not about the money. There are a dozen places we go that's about 20+ a person for a burger with side and don't always even include the drink. You still want It to make sense. The quality wasn't there.\n\nNo excuses. I make burgers with prime rib or any other manner of beef all the time. Never come out this dry and hard.\n\nMeat was over pressed. There is no space for the fats and makes the meat dense. Not juicey like it should be. The  bread and toppings were good but the brick of meat in the center really threw it off. Service was flat. The freezer tots were overcooked. There was some kind of burn (not about temperature) flavor to them. Maybe double cooked? Too many places in the area I would rather get food.\n\nThe wings would have to be more than spectacular (there was an issue so we didn't get them) My wife eats Jack in the Box! Her bar is low, she loves burgers. This is a definant no, thank you.",

No one said these burgers were flame-grilled like Burger King and completely unseasoned. Cajun fries had no salt and the catfish was also unseasoned. The guy who took our orders was nice, but he was kinda weird and started while we ate. Almost like he was seeing if we liked the food. Trust me, it‚Äôs beyond mediocre. If you like or must eat unseasoned food, this might be a place for you. But by NO means should this pop up in Google‚Äôs answers when one searches best burgers in Dallas. No thank you. Lemon pepper wings were the best thing and were about a 3.5 out of 5. Fried pickles were a 1 with nasty batter. Everything was made fresh though. However, these reviews and pictures are deceiving, and the food is tasteless and expensive.",

But the customer service was terrible. The gentleman working the front was not approachable and when I asked for suggestions about customer favorites he gave a short rude answer. I asked for all flats and his response was I don't think they can do it but he never checked to see. After I got my wings and went to my car I noticed he did not place my ranch in my bag when I got out the car in the cold to get the ranch he ask me about 3 times if I'm sure I didn't have it in box or bag and I was definitely sure. The place was literally empty but his energy gave the vibe that they were busy. I ate in car and for it to be a after hours restaurant I saw no customers come in so it's strange that he was so rude. I  wouldn't recommend this place.",

The chicken was mid at best but the sauces tasted like they both came straight out of bottle. I tried both the buffalo (Their most RECOMMENDED wing) and the honey bbq. Straight up tasted like franks red hot sauce and generic bbq sauce that I could have grabbed from McDonald‚Äôs. If I‚Äôm paying this much for a meal, the wings deserve to be on point. I could have saved both my pallet and my wallet by just going to bdubs or wingstop. Best wings in Dallas you told me? Get a grip. I am not a picky eater but in the 8 months I have been with my partner I have never sent back food. I‚Äôm embarrassed and beyond disappointed to have dined here. Trust me we will not be back üôè",

How are frozen tater tots and a small drink the same price? Doubled the total for what? It's not about the money. There are a dozen places we go that's about 20+ a person for a burger with side and don't always even include the drink. You still want It to make sense. The quality wasn't there.\n\nNo excuses. I make burgers with prime rib or any other manner of beef all the time. Never come out this dry and hard.\n\nMeat was over pressed. There is no space for the fats and makes the meat dense. Not juicey like it should be. The  bread and toppings were good but the brick of meat in the center really threw it off. Service was flat. The freezer tots were overcooked. There was some kind of burn (not about temperature) flavor to them. Maybe double cooked? Too many places in the area I would rather get food.\n\nThe wings would have to be more than spectacular (there was an issue so we didn't get them) My wife eats Jack in the Box! Her bar is low, she loves burgers. This is a definant no, thank you.",

We order the employee came in and went straight to the back to cook our food, no handwriting. The meat was a frozen patty. The burger was the nastiest burger I've ever eaten. We are from Denver and we know Dallas has goof food well a few years ago food was good here. I couldn't eat the burger the little bit I ate made me extremely sick!!!!

Enough about the food.... what motivated me to write a positive review is this little act of service they did.\nI had a fairly large order....or rather a large SPECIFIC order. Anyone with younger kids knows how difficult it can be to order burgers to each person's wishes....get the order right or face to consequences of an angry kid that won't eat (and the subsequent \"discussion\" about being grateful for a burger in the first place). Anyway, I had FOUR DIFFERENT iterations of the same hamburger + three different wing orders. If you look at the picture I posted, you see that Solo Burger was SUPER THOUGHTFUL to pack each burger in a separate bag, number each bag, AND put the corresponding number next to the order on the ticket so you knew what was in each bag. I never even asked them to  do that. For those of you who don't know, the second great challenge after ordering food, is figuring out whose burger is whose when you get home. It's the little things, like this thoughtful act, which helps them stand out from the rest. Thank you solo burger.",

They were so crispy I almost didn't eat them cuz I thought they were breaded.. lucky for me the owner took the time and asked if I didn't like em due to me asking for a To go box right after I tried one.

No one said these burgers were flame-grilled like Burger King and completely unseasoned. Cajun fries had no salt and the catfish was also unseasoned. The guy who took our orders was nice, but he was kinda weird and started while we ate. Almost like he was seeing if we liked the food. Trust me, it‚Äôs beyond mediocre. If you like or must eat unseasoned food, this might be a place for you. But by NO means should this pop up in Google‚Äôs answers when one searches best burgers in Dallas. No thank you. Lemon pepper wings were the best thing and were about a 3.5 out of 5. Fried pickles were a 1 with nasty batter. Everything was made fresh though.
