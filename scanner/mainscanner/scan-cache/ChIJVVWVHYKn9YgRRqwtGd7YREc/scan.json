            "text": "I can‚Äôt rave about meals by melissa enough. I have been receiving meals for 1 month now. They are absolutely delicious, filling, and there was never a repeated meal in 4 weeks\n\nMy meals are customized to accommodate my preferences and are delivered to my door every week. My husband tasted my meals and loved it. He orders with me now too.\n\nSurprisingly, this homemade and specialized service is very affordable. In fact my food bill has decreased since getting meals by Melissa.\n\nGive Melissa a call - she is very approachable and goes out of her way to satisfy your every need. Melissa‚Äôs service makes you feel extravagant , without the extravagant price tag!\n\nOh, and I lost 5 pounds. Don‚Äôt sleep on meals by Melissa- you‚Äôll be very happy with your decision!\n\nStacy E",

I ordered meals from them from Too good too go app. They told me to grab it from 10:00 - 10:30am the next day. I paid everything before picking it up the next day. Guess what? The next day when my friend came, she couldn‚Äôt reach out to the owner by either call or text. Then the owner proceeded to cancel my order while my friend was waiting to pick up my order without saying a word?????? YOU COULD HAVE CANCELED THE ORDER OR TELL THERE‚ÄôS NO SUPPLY LEFT BEFORE SOMEONE COME TO PICK UP THE ORDER. I will never recommend anyone to order here!",
