Parking was a little difficult with limited street parking, but I found out afterward that the Gateway Ramp nearby offers cheaper parking with a voucher ‚Äî good to know for next time!\n\nThe hostess was so thoughtful ‚Äî she noticed I had my iPad and seated me in a quiet area so I could work peacefully, which I really appreciated.\n\nFood-wise, everything was on point. The red pepper bruschetta (just two pieces) was crunchy, chewy, and packed with flavor. The vodka pasta was rich and satisfying, and the cannoli was a light, sweet finish. Each portion was well-balanced ‚Äî I left feeling full but not heavy.\n\nGreat solo lunch spot with cozy vibes and excellent service. I‚Äôd definitely come back!",

Reservation was required but it wasn't as busy at the time we came in, probably because it was a Monday.\n\nFor appetizers we started with the red pepper bruschetta and spinach dip (spinach, sundried tomato, fontina cheese, served with house-made deep fried pasta chips); entrees were both chicken Parmesan (mix of red and white sauce I believe, classic mozzarella, fresh garlic, and bucatini); then finishing with dessert of cannolis and tiramisu. All of it was excellent, I particularly liked the chicken Parmesan, the flavor of the sauce and bucatini paired with the presentation, chefs kiss. Very generous portion!\n\nI would skip on the spinach dip, something about it just didn't hit as well as say a spinach artichoke dip but I'm definitely interested in coming back and trying other things on the menu! Great RW experience!",

The atmosphere is on the loud side and the hostess spoke in a whisper and the waiter was also very quiet. I had to ask both of them to repeat things several times. We have sat near where the food comes out a couple of times and I just don't understand what the older men are doing.  Are they expediters? Managers? They seem to have perfected looking busy without doing much. They do not check on customers or interact with them at all.

The fried brie was absolutely delicious. My beet salad was fine, the dressing overwhelmed the salad and made it very one note. The steak on his cesar was several levels overcooked (He ordered mid rare, it came out well) and bland. The beverages were yum, the entrees were lacking. I wish we had just split a couple more appetizers instead. Service was attentive and jovial. We enjoyed the banter. Eato is acceptable casual dining. It's a bit out of the way for me so I probably won't go back. There are just too many great options out there. If I've lived a short walk away, I'd probably give it another go.",

Reservation was required but it wasn't as busy at the time we came in, probably because it was a Monday.\n\nFor appetizers we started with the red pepper bruschetta and spinach dip (spinach, sundried tomato, fontina cheese, served with house-made deep fried pasta chips); entrees were both chicken Parmesan (mix of red and white sauce I believe, classic mozzarella, fresh garlic, and bucatini); then finishing with dessert of cannolis and tiramisu. All of it was excellent, I particularly liked the chicken Parmesan, the flavor of the sauce and bucatini paired with the presentation, chefs kiss. Very generous portion!\n\nI would skip on the spinach dip, something about it just didn't hit as well as say a spinach artichoke dip but I'm definitely interested in coming back and trying other things on the menu! Great RW experience!",

Doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve just traveled to Japan where service of all kinds is impeccable. Today I stopped by EATO to order a pizza to go and you‚Äôd think I was at a Michelin-starred restaurant. The gentleman that welcomed me and took care of my order may have been the manager but acted like the owner! Excellent presence and demeanor, looked me in the eye as he spoke, offered me a glass of water while I waited for my order, let me know it would be about 15 minutes, and no more than 10 minutes later he delivered my piping hot pizza. And they were busy!! GREAT job EATO. I‚Äôll be back soon‚ù£Ô∏è",

The atmosphere is on the loud side and the hostess spoke in a whisper and the waiter was also very quiet. I had to ask both of them to repeat things several times. We have sat near where the food comes out a couple of times and I just don't understand what the older men are doing.  Are they expediters? Managers? They seem to have perfected looking busy without doing much. They do not check on customers or interact with them at all. I made eye contact with one on my way out and he didn't ask how anything was or even nod or smile at me.",

Sometimes you order a pizza and it‚Äôs thing and crispy, sometimes it‚Äôs thick and floppy. Sometimes the Caesar salad has great dressing, sometimes it tastes like mayo. We‚Äôve come here over 4 years and almost every time the food is drastically different in taste. I‚Äôm finally ready to stop trying to make the cute Italian wine shop a good place to eat.",

The corpse reviver #2 was acceptable but ordered just a normal old fashioned which was awful. Sorry, but for $110 this should have been great. Very disappointed.",
