We chose the Goose's Acre because of its location. It was a rare lovely spring day and we wanted to be outside. This restaurant has a nice patio beside the waterway. Seating was a little hectic. There is an upstairs hostess station and a downstairs hostess station. We were directed to the downstairs hostess for outside seating. The waitress was nice and took our drink order quickly, however the bar was slow to get the drinks out. I ordered the Spare Rib dinner and my wife had a salad with steak. I felt the vegetables were bland on my plate, but the sweet potato mash and rib were perfect. However the Spare Rib portion seemed a little small, maybe 5-6 ounces. I recommend an appetizer with that meal.",

Very friendly, shared the history of the restaurant and gave some suggestions for local sights. I had the gluten-free tuna poke and the derby salad without cheese and bacon with an unsweetened ice tea. Poke was definitely my favourite highlight.\n\nMy only downsides were that my table had water dripping from the ceiling vent, and there were no seat covers in the restroom. Small things that can be easily improved, but the interior has a unique aesthetic. A nice, warm feel, and everyone greeted me in passing. I will return again.",

          "text": "I love Ireland and love to try local Irish pubs. At first glance, the place looks great and a cool atmosphere. We sat on the patio by the water. The waitress was great. She was very attentive and took our order promptly. Food and drinks came out quickly. The food all looked great. I ate a few bites of my French dip sandwich which tasted very good. Started to try to eat my Parmesan fries. They were cold and broken in pieces. I dug around to find a bigger fry and found 2 half eaten shrimp tails in my fries. I immediately was put off by this and stopped eating. The waitress was very apologetic and took the food away. The service manager came over and asked what the problem was and I told him. He said we will get to the bottom of this and asked if I wanted something else. At this point, I was nauseated not knowing if I was eating used food so I said no. The rest of the people at my table, ate their food. Enjoyed it and thought it was delicious. Like I said, my sandwich was good, but the whole fry experience turned me totally off. The waitress gave me an excuse that in the prep area the tails must have came from the shrimp thst were from the bang bang tacos. Which, by the way, no one at my table was eating shrimp. She assumed that someone was making tacos and somehow the tails ended up in my fries. This does not make sense to me since it look like the tails would have been taken off after the shrimp were fried? It still looks like someone bit the shrimp off of these and threw the tails down. Like I said, the food and service was good until this happened. They did take my meal off our receipt. But I will not be back considering I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre serving used food or not.",

Don‚Äôt miss out on Guinness on tap, it was a perfect way to kick off the weekend.  Unfortunately it was January and cold, so we didn‚Äôt enjoy the outside, but I‚Äôm looking forward to enjoying it when the weather warms up.  The menu is very extensive and tasty.  We started with fried pickles and jalape√±os.  The beer was very good to cool the spice of the jalape√±os.  I had the Reuben and it was killer- thick sliced very tender corned beef with just the right dosage of kraut, dressing and cheese!  The fish and chips were perfectly breaded and the fish was flakey and tender!  We thought the prices were just right and the portions were plenty without being overdone on quantity.

She was very attentive and took our order promptly. Food and drinks came out quickly. The food all looked great. I ate a few bites of my French dip sandwich which tasted very good. Started to try to eat my Parmesan fries. They were cold and broken in pieces. I dug around to find a bigger fry and found 2 half eaten shrimp tails in my fries. I immediately was put off by this and stopped eating. The waitress was very apologetic and took the food away. The service manager came over and asked what the problem was and I told him. He said we will get to the bottom of this and asked if I wanted something else. At this point, I was nauseated not knowing if I was eating used food so I said no. The rest of the people at my table, ate their food. Enjoyed it and thought it was delicious. Like I said, my sandwich was good, but the whole fry experience turned me totally off. The waitress gave me an excuse that in the prep area the tails must have came from the shrimp thst were from the bang bang tacos. Which, by the way, no one at my table was eating shrimp. She assumed that someone was making tacos and somehow the tails ended up in my fries. This does not make sense to me since it look like the tails would have been taken off after the shrimp were fried? It still looks like someone bit the shrimp off of these and threw the tails down.

We started with fried pickles and jalape√±os.  The beer was very good to cool the spice of the jalape√±os.  I had the Reuben and it was killer- thick sliced very tender corned beef with just the right dosage of kraut, dressing and cheese!  The fish and chips were perfectly breaded and the fish was flakey and tender!  We thought the prices were just right and the portions were plenty without being overdone on quantity.  A great experience to repeat again!",
