I eat this pizza maybe 3/5 days a week. Melinda is very kind and sweet always greets me with a smile. I recommend this place to anyone. This is like one of my favorites pepperoni, itialian sausage and jalape√±o. SO IF YOU‚ÄôRE IN MCKINNEY YOU SHOULD STOP BY!!!!!",

You will not be disappointed!!!",

I'd like to start off by saying if you like a lot of spices/herbs, it's great. The chicken was wonderful, and my boyfriend really liked the pasta - so this is mostly my own experience.\nUnfortunately, one bite of the pasta was overwhelming for me. There also seemed to be a spicy tinge as well that left my tongue numb - are there chili flakes in the sauce? I have a mild allergy to most peppers. I did not disclose this because the listing made no mention of spiciness and other locations didn't include it. I'll be sure to mention it next time to be safe.",

I'd like to start off by saying if you like a lot of spices/herbs, it's great. The chicken was wonderful, and my boyfriend really liked the pasta - so this is mostly my own experience.\nUnfortunately, one bite of the pasta was overwhelming for me. There also seemed to be a spicy tinge as well that left my tongue numb - are there chili flakes in the sauce? I have a mild allergy to most peppers. I did not disclose this because the listing made no mention of spiciness and other locations didn't include it. I'll be sure to mention it next time to be safe.",

They stretch the dough so thin it cannot handle the extra sauce.  It seems to me they use the same amount of dough for the L and XL but stretch it more in order to charge the XL prices.  The pizza tastes good but it is definitely not worth the price.",
