Unfortunately there were only two people working in the restaurant at the moment me and my family were there, so the service was running pretty slow. Furthermore, my stepmom ordered a Pesto Artichoke Pizza but instead got an Artichoke Pizza with marinara sauce and no tomatoes. It eventually took us about an hour to get our food, and another 5 minutes for water. The waitress was nice but as I stated the service was slow.",

About two months ago I went with a group of people but this time I went alone. I was the only customer dining in the restaurant but there were several to-go orders while I was there. Last time I had a sandwich so this time I wanted to try something different. I ordered a small Caesar salad and a small margarita pizza. My salad came out first and it was absolutely delicious. The ingredients were very fresh, homemade croutons were super crunchy and flavorful, they really piled on the parmigiana, which I love and the Caesar dressing was bright and tangy. The margarita pizza is one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. There was so much cheese it was almost absurd, in a really delicious way! The crust was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I really enjoyed the addition of minced garlic to the top. The waiter was the younger guy that was there before. As before he was very polite and no intrusive. When I finished my meal I asked for the check and since I had some time left before I needed to go back to the office I asked if he minded if I sat for a while. He graciously said of course and even brought me some ice water when I saw I had finished my drink. Over all a wonderful and relaxing experience and I will be back and look forward to trying another item on the menu. Thank you Cafe Roma for your hospitality.",

Unfortunately there were only two people working in the restaurant at the moment me and my family were there, so the service was running pretty slow. Furthermore, my stepmom ordered a Pesto Artichoke Pizza but instead got an Artichoke Pizza with marinara sauce and no tomatoes. It eventually took us about an hour to get our food, and another 5 minutes for water. The waitress was nice but as I stated the service was slow.",

Good service, clean establishment and lovely atmospher I must say.\n\nI was the only person at the restaurant so there was no rush or need to be in a hurry to prepare my food.\nSo let's get into this dish ...\nBasic at best, nothing to sing or write about and that's disappointing because eating in New Orleans I expected more of them.\n\nThe shrimp were really small and not seasoned AT ALL. You would think an Italian restaurant would offer a hint of garlic and seasoning but no there was nothing. It was just thrown into the skillet with the linguine and Alfredo sauce.\n\nThe linguine was a perfect texture and the Alfredo had a nice BASIC homemade Alfredo taste (I've have more flavor from a Bertolli jar by far). So before you get caught on the word \"homemade\" I only mean that it was made from scratch. Not that it was made with flavor, love, or a whisper from their Italian ancestors letting them know to put a sprinkle of garlic and herbs in the food. It was disappointing to say the least.\n\nOn the plus side the food was made fresh and the small slice of garlic cheese bread was the real MVP of my meal. It was the only thing truly flavorful that made me smile.\n\nI had a small Caesar salad and I have no complaints the lettuce was good produce and the dressing was delicious.\n\nI'm just disheartened to say that the small side pieces were the standout stars of my meal. For $23 I would have gotten a better meal from Olive garden (and I have not eaten at Olive garden in over 15 years).  No shade to olive garden I'd eat there if I had to with no complaints. I would definitely go there before this place again.\n\nMaybe it was because there was no one else there and it was a slow day and the chef didn't come out to play. Idk what I do know is I can't personally recommend this place on my experience. I do have a feeling that if it were a good day business  wise for them the food might have been better.\n\nI will never know because I will not be going back.",

          "text": "This is my second review of Cafe Roma. I was back in New Orleans this week and wanted to try Cafe Roma again. About two months ago I went with a group of people but this time I went alone. I was the only customer dining in the restaurant but there were several to-go orders while I was there. Last time I had a sandwich so this time I wanted to try something different. I ordered a small Caesar salad and a small margarita pizza. My salad came out first and it was absolutely delicious. The ingredients were very fresh, homemade croutons were super crunchy and flavorful, they really piled on the parmigiana, which I love and the Caesar dressing was bright and tangy. The margarita pizza is one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. There was so much cheese it was almost absurd, in a really delicious way! The crust was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I really enjoyed the addition of minced garlic to the top. The waiter was the younger guy that was there before. As before he was very polite and no intrusive. When I finished my meal I asked for the check and since I had some time left before I needed to go back to the office I asked if he minded if I sat for a while. He graciously said of course and even brought me some ice water when I saw I had finished my drink. Over all a wonderful and relaxing experience and I will be back and look forward to trying another item on the menu. Thank you Cafe Roma for your hospitality.",

After opening the delivery I honestly though a cat had thrown up. I appreciate deliveries can be difficult and the roads in New Orleans are bad, but food needs to look a little bit appetising. Maybe the taste will make up for it. No taste. It was so bland. Like tomato sauce and some flat pasta. The nam bread style garlic bread was tasteless. I guess my quest for a decent lasagne continues.

          "text": "FYI. This place has paid Uber Eats to create a alter ego restaurant rebranded with a different name, Penne Place, with identical menu items that costs more money. Why would any business do this? Perhaps Uber Eats solicited them with the idea to boost business to justify the steep percentage Uber Eats charges the restaurant on sales. Whatever the reason is, it‚Äôs deceiving the customer and more people need to be aware this is happening. The Italian Pie was the first place I noticed electing to do this, but i wasn‚Äôt as bothered because I don‚Äôt like their food anyway. When Cafe Roma (which I actually liked) did the same, I felt it was important for other people to know to make their dining choices more ‚Äúinformed‚Äù from the deceitful practices this business chooses to participate in.",

I could come down and show you how to make true lasagna. Italian food not close. Atleast the salad was good but you can't mess that up. This is me being nice and not rude in anyway. But frozen Sysco lasagna not very good.",
