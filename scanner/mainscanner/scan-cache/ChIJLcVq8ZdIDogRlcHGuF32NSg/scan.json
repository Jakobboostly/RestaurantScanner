Service was quick, food is delicious, and the staff was probably the friendliest bunch we have run into in years. My wife mis-ordered our pizza - no problem - they gave us some prosciutto to put on top, even though it was our mistake. At least 4 of them then stopped by our table to see if everything was OK. And they also sell ice cream - the perfect ending to a delicious meal. Great salad, soup, and of course, the wonderful pizza. If you're local, go often, but if you're cruising down I-55 and a bit hungry, it's definitely worth a stop, and it won't wreck your budget or your schedule.",

When ordering I noticed all of the beer tap handles were removed, no problem I asked what beer and wine they had available.  The person behind the counter informed me that the new owners have decided to remove alcohol from the menu.\n\nAfter ordering our sausage and pepperoni pizza it came out fairly quickly.  There was far more crust without ingredients than in the past and less cheese.  The crust was good the rest of the pizza was average at best.  For the price there are far better options in the area.  With the lack of beer and wine options we will not be back.",

Service was quick, food is delicious, and the staff was probably the friendliest bunch we have run into in years. My wife mis-ordered our pizza - no problem - they gave us some prosciutto to put on top, even though it was our mistake. At least 4 of them then stopped by our table to see if everything was OK. And they also sell ice cream - the perfect ending to a delicious meal. Great salad, soup, and of course, the wonderful pizza. If you're local, go often, but if you're cruising down I-55 and a bit hungry, it's definitely worth a stop, and it won't wreck your budget or your schedule.",

When ordering I noticed all of the beer tap handles were removed, no problem I asked what beer and wine they had available.  The person behind the counter informed me that the new owners have decided to remove alcohol from the menu.\n\nAfter ordering our sausage and pepperoni pizza it came out fairly quickly.  There was far more crust without ingredients than in the past and less cheese.  The crust was good the rest of the pizza was average at best.  For the price there are far better options in the area.  With the lack of beer and wine options we will not be back.",
