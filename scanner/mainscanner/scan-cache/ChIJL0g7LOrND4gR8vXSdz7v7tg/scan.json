Got to chat with the owner George ‚Äî super friendly and great to hear the story behind the place. Staff was just as welcoming.\n\nThis is pickup only, but 100% worth going in. I grabbed a cold brew from down the street and hung out while they made the pizza.\n\nAs a pizza fan, this really hit the mark ‚Äî classic Chicago thin crust (think Father & Son‚Äôs or John‚Äôs Pizza). Thin, crispy, perfectly cooked. Glad I finally tried it ‚Äî will definitely be back!",

Im a southsider so i dont know about too many pizza places on the northside. Place was cool and quaint, rwminding me of one of those old school pizza shops in the 90's (I'm a millinenal lol). Plus once i saw the pizza boxes with the country of Italy on in Red, white and green on them I knew it was gonna be good.\nCame was greeted by the young guys and Jorge the owner who was taking care of some business out in the front. They said they was out of slices but could make me a fresh small at the same as the slice. I was like say less lmao. Had to wait 10 minutes but that was cool. As i was waiting me and the owner engaged in a quick conversation and was cool to have a genuine talk with someone today in this climate. Plus i saw his Puerto Rican pride displayed in his ring and more in which i admire because my big brorher is Puerto Rican. He's a good guy I can tell and humble. Love that. He was telling how they make the crust and everyting from scratch (which was on full display by the guys working). After all that he gave me a free drink for my paitence and to let him know about the pizza.\n\nWell after all that i say this....This is Chicago Pizza thru and thru! Nothing more nothing less. Good sauce, great crust, good cheese and seasoned evenly. Down to the squared cut. Definelty a spot to keep in mind next time i visit the Northside.",

I would honestly say that the sauce was good, and the pizza was cooked to perfection. It had the perfect amount of cheese, toppings, and sauce. Bravo to all the cooks!\n\nThank you so much. You are now our new pizza place, and we apologize for not ordering sooner. We will make up for it. I haven't tried the thin crust, but I bet it will also be delicious.\n\nThanks again!!!",

          "text": "After having several bad pizzas from a couple of different places that I normally order from, I found Bellonas. I don't know what's happening with quality in the food world, but I'm super glad I looked into some other neighborhood places!!\nThe gentleman that took my order was very friendly, placed my order quickly and I received it in less than an hour and it was DELICIOUS!! I was craving old school Chicago thin crust with good quality cheese and sausage, and that is exactly what I got! Bellonas is my new go-to pizza place!",
