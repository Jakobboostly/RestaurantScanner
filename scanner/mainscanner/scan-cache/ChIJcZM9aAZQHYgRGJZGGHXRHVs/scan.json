I don't think they have much time when its busy, as it was on our trip, to keep up with the dropped food under tables and such. Our pizza was really good and we got the big pretzel, well, just becuase. Its huge! Drinks were good. Our waitress was friendly enough but was less then attentive. We had to call to her/ stop her as she was going past our table to get water refills and order drinks. Views  from our table were lovely and on the deck was live music. Hard to hear each other talk but totally expected with a large crowd and live music. Mix of ages  including families and people with their dogs. Overall enjoyed the experience.",

We asked for an outdoor seat, took a little longer but it was worth it.\nThe beer selection was extremely good, lots to choose from. The thin crust pizza surprised me. I didn't expect to be very good. I was very wrong. The cheese mixture was excellent. We also ordered wings. Those were a 9 out of 10. I always expect pigeon sized wings at restaurants, what they serve are HUGE. And the mild sauce for them is honestly one of the best sauces, in a mild flavor, that I've ever had.\nI will definitely be going back to this place on my next trip.",

So, going outside the area for pizza isn‚Äôt always satisfying.\n\nI‚Äôll start by saying that I eat my entire half of the pizza. But I need to be fair. We ordered one of their signature veggie pizzas. The crust was tasty, well-cooked, slightly crisp, and slightly soft. There was a lot of flour, and the sauce was okay. It was more like a pur√©e with small chunks of tomatoes. They put a decent amount on it for my wife, but I needed to order extra sauce.\n\nOur very young server, who overall gave us excellent service, brought the sauce out cold. ü•∂ The cheese was your standard mozzarella mix, and it was plentiful and served at the perfect temperature.\n\nMy biggest problem was that for a signature pizza, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of signature ingredients. It was pretty much missing the mushrooms, very few tiny pieces of green peppers and onions, and it looked like one very small Roma tomato was cut up on top. My wife is a meat eater, so she got pepperoni on her half, and there was plenty of that. It was tasty and not greasy.\n\nI suppose if you‚Äôre coming from Idaho, this pizza would be absolutely amazing. The ambiance was great, and we had a beautiful view of the bay. The staff is mostly very young and probably just making some extra money for the summer. everybody was very friendly.",

I don't think they have much time when its busy, as it was on our trip, to keep up with the dropped food under tables and such. Our pizza was really good and we got the big pretzel, well, just becuase. Its huge! Drinks were good. Our waitress was friendly enough but was less then attentive. We had to call to her/ stop her as she was going past our table to get water refills and order drinks. Views  from our table were lovely and on the deck was live music. Hard to hear each other talk but totally expected with a large crowd and live music. Mix of ages  including families and people with their dogs. Overall enjoyed the experience.",

So, going outside the area for pizza isn‚Äôt always satisfying.\n\nI‚Äôll start by saying that I eat my entire half of the pizza. But I need to be fair. We ordered one of their signature veggie pizzas. The crust was tasty, well-cooked, slightly crisp, and slightly soft. There was a lot of flour, and the sauce was okay. It was more like a pur√©e with small chunks of tomatoes. They put a decent amount on it for my wife, but I needed to order extra sauce.\n\nOur very young server, who overall gave us excellent service, brought the sauce out cold. ü•∂ The cheese was your standard mozzarella mix, and it was plentiful and served at the perfect temperature.\n\nMy biggest problem was that for a signature pizza, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of signature ingredients. It was pretty much missing the mushrooms, very few tiny pieces of green peppers and onions, and it looked like one very small Roma tomato was cut up on top. My wife is a meat eater, so she got pepperoni on her half, and there was plenty of that. It was tasty and not greasy.\n\nI suppose if you‚Äôre coming from Idaho, this pizza would be absolutely amazing. The ambiance was great, and we had a beautiful view of the bay. The staff is mostly very young and probably just making some extra money for the summer. everybody was very friendly.",

We asked for an outdoor seat, took a little longer but it was worth it.\nThe beer selection was extremely good, lots to choose from. The thin crust pizza surprised me. I didn't expect to be very good. I was very wrong. The cheese mixture was excellent. We also ordered wings. Those were a 9 out of 10. I always expect pigeon sized wings at restaurants, what they serve are HUGE. And the mild sauce for them is honestly one of the best sauces, in a mild flavor, that I've ever had.\nI will definitely be going back to this place on my next trip.",

I don't think they have much time when its busy, as it was on our trip, to keep up with the dropped food under tables and such. Our pizza was really good and we got the big pretzel, well, just becuase. Its huge! Drinks were good. Our waitress was friendly enough but was less then attentive. We had to call to her/ stop her as she was going past our table to get water refills and order drinks. Views  from our table were lovely and on the deck was live music. Hard to hear each other talk but totally expected with a large crowd and live music. Mix of ages  including families and people with their dogs. Overall enjoyed the experience.",
